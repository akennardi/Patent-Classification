15
   Figures 1 and 2 show a hairdryer 10 with a handle 20 and a body 30.       The handle has a
   first end 22 which is connected to the body 30 and a second end 24 distal from the body
   30 and which includes a primary fluid inlet 40. Power is supplied to the hairdryer 10
   via a cable 50.
20
   The body 30 has a first end 32 and a second end 34 and can be considered to have two
   parts. A first part 36 which extends from the first end 32 which is generally tubular and
   a second part 38 which extends from the second end 34 to join the first part 36. The
   second part 38 is cone shaped and varies in diameter along its length from the diameter
25 of the first part 36 of the body 30 to a smaller diameter at the second end 34 of the body.
   In this example, the second part 38 has a constant gradient and the angle a subtended
   from the outer wall 360 of the first part 36 of the body 30 in this example is around 400.
   The handle 20 has an outer wall 200 which extends from the body 30 to a distal end 24
30 of the handle. At the distal end 24 of the handle an end wall 210 extends across the
   outer wall 200. The cable 50 enters the hairdryer through this end wall 210. The

                                                   10
   primary fluid inlet 40 in the handle 20 includes first apertures that extend around and
   along 42 the outer wall 200 of the handle and second apertures that extend across 46 and
   through the end wall 210 of the handle 20. The cable 50 is located approximately in the
   middle of the end wall 210 so extends from the centre of the handle 20. The end wall
 5 210 is orthogonal to the outer wall 200 and an inner wall 220 of the handle.
   Upstream of the primary fluid inlet 40, a fan unit 70 is provided. The fan unit 70
    includes a fan and a motor. The fan unit 70 draws fluid through the primary fluid inlet
   40 towards the body 30 through a primary fluid flow path 400 that extends from the
10 primary fluid inlet 40 and into the body 30 where the handle 20 and the body 30 are
   joined 90. The primary fluid flow path 400 continues through the body 30 towards the
    second end 34 of the body, around a heater 80 and to a primary fluid outlet 440 where
    fluid that is drawn in by the fan unit exits the primary fluid flow path 400. The primary
    fluid flow path 400 is non linear and flows through the handle 20 in a first direction and
15 through the body 30 in a second direction which is orthogonal to the first direction.
   The body 30 includes an outer wall 360 and an inner duct 310. The primary fluid flow
   path 400 extends along the body from the junction 90 of the handle 20 and the body 30
    between the outer wall 360 and the duct 310 towards the primary fluid outlet 440 at the
20  second end 34 of the body 30.
   Another fluid flow path is provided within the body; this flow is not directly processed
    by the fan unit or the heater but is drawn into the hairdryer by the action of the fan unit
   producing the primary flow through the hairdryer. This fluid flow is entrained into the
25 hairdryer by the fluid flowing through the primary fluid flow path 400.
   The first end 32 of the body includes a fluid inlet 320 and the second end 34 of the body
    includes a fluid outlet 340. Both the fluid inlet 320 and the fluid outlet 340 are at least
   partially defined by the duct 310 which is an inner wall of the body 30 and extends
30 within and along the body. A fluid flow path 300 extends within the duct from the fluid
    inlet 320 to the fluid outlet 340. At the first end 32 of the body 30, a side wall 350

                                                 11
   extends between the outer wall 360 and the duct 310. This side wall 350 at least
   partially defines the fluid inlet 320. At the second end 34 of the body a gap is provided
   between the outer wall 360 and the duct, this gap defines the primary fluid outlet 440.
   The primary fluid outlet 440 is annular and surrounds the fluid flow path. The primary
 5 fluid outlet 440 may be internal so the primary fluid flow path 400 merges with the fluid
   flow path 300 within the body 30. Alternatively, the primary fluid outlet 440 is external
   and exits from the body 30 separately to the fluid from the fluid flow path 300 at the
   fluid outlet 340.
10 The outer wall 360 of the body converges towards the duct 310 and a centre line A-A of
   the body 30. Having an outer wall 360 that converges towards the duct 310 has the
   advantage that the primary flow exiting the primary fluid outlet 440 is directed towards
   the centre line A-A of the body 30. The fluid exiting the primary fluid outlet 440 will
   cause some external entrainment of fluid 490 from outside the hairdryer due to the
15 movement of the fluid from the primary outlet 440. This effect is increased by the outer
   wall 360 converging towards the duct 310. Partly this is because the primary flow is
   focused rather than divergent and partly this is because of the slope of the outer wall
   360 of the body 30 towards the second end 34 of the hairdiyer.
20 The duct 310 is an internal wall of the hairdryer that can be accessed from outside the
   hairdryer. Thus, the duct 310 is an external wall of the hairdryer. The duct 310 is
   recessed within the body 30 so the side wall 350 that connects between the outer wall
   360 and the duct 310 is angled with respect to the outer wall 360.
25 A PCB 75 including the control electronics for the hairdryer is located in the body 30
   near the side wall 350 and fluid inlet 320. The PCB 75 is ring shaped and extends
   round the duct 310 between the duct 310 and the outer wall 360. The PCB 75 is in fluid
   communication with the primary fluid flow path 400. The PCB 75 extends about the
   fluid flow path 300 and is isolated from the fluid flow path 300 by the duct 310.
30

                                                 12
   The PCB 75 controls such parameters as the temperature of the heater 80 and the speed
   of rotation of the fan unit 70. Internal wiring (not shown) electrically connects the PCB
   75 to the heater 80 and the fan unit 70 and the cable 50. Control buttons 62, 64 are
   provided and connected to the PCB 75 to enable a user to select from a range of
 5 temperature settings and flow rates for example.
   In use, fluid is drawn into the primary fluid flow path 400 by the action of the fan unit
   70, is optionally heated by the heater 80 and exits from the primary fluid outlet 440.
   This processed flow causes fluid to be entrained into the fluid flow path 300 at the fluid
10 inlet 320. The fluid combines with the processed flow at the second end 34 of the body.
   In the example shown in Figure 2, the processed flow exits the primary fluid outlet 440
   and the hairdryer as an annular flow which surrounds the entrained flow that exits from
   the hairdryer via the fluid outlet 340. Thus fluid that is processed by the fan unit and
   heater is augmented by the entrained flow.
15
   The handle 20 has an outer wall 200 and an inner wall 250 which at least partially
   defines the primary fluid flow path 400 through the handle 20. The inner wall 250
   extends from the body 30 to a downstream end 254 towards the second end 24 of the
   handle 20. The handle 20 is tubular and the outer wall 200 of the handle 20 is a
20 cylindrical sleeve made from any suitable material such as moulded plastic or a rolled
   sheet of metal such as aluminium, an aluminium alloy or a steel. The handle connects
   to the body 30 at a first end 22 and at the distal, second end 24 a primary fluid inlet 40 is
   provided. The primary fluid inlet 40 is a first means of filtering fluid that enters the
   primary fluid flow path 400.
25
   Referring now to Figure 3, a lining material 270 is positioned between the inner wall
   250 and the outer wall 200.      The lining material 270 is a foam or a felt which at least
   attenuates noise (has a silencing effect) produced when fluid is drawn into the handle 20
   by the fan unit 70. For clarity, the lining material 270 has been shown around only a
30 part of the inner wall 250.    To enable contact between the lining material 270 and the
   fluid flowing in the primary fluid flow path 400 and thus attenuation of noise, the inner

                                                 13
   wall 250 is provided with perforations 256 that extend around and at least partially
   along the length of the inner wall 250.
   The lining material 270 is provided to reduce noise produced when fluid is drawn into
 5 the primary fluid inlet 40 by the action of the fan unit 70.
   The perforations 256 of the inner wall 220 are of a diameter which is chosen to
   attenuate noise most effectively. Diameters of Imm to 10mm are suitable; the smaller
   diameters being better for obtaining a good sound power (reducing sound over the main
10 human sound range) and the larger diameters are good for high frequency attenuation.
   The perforations preferably form at least 40% of the surface area of the inner wall 220,
   250.
   By having the lining material 270 disposed behind the inner wall 250 one is able to use
15 a greater thickness of lining material than if the lining material 270 was directed
   exposed to the primary fluid flow path. This is because the diameter of the primary
   fluid flow path 400 is determined by the inner wall 250 which squashes the lining
   material 270 in to the gap between the inner wall 250 and the outer wall 200 of the
   handle 20.    Typically, the lining material is between 4 and 6mm thick but will be
20 compressed between the outer wall 200 and the inner wall 250.
   An important feature of having a multi layered handle 20 is that the material properties
   can be used to improve the mitigation of noise produced by the product. Airborne noise
   produced by the fan unit 70 and fluid flowing into the primary fluid flow path 400 is
25 attenuated by the lining material 270; however some noise is transmitted through the
   lining material 270.
   An additional feature required by the handle 20 is for it to be of sufficient stiffness to
   provide a grippable handle which will not readily bend which would introduce a
30 restriction into the primary fluid flow path.      Thus, materials such as aluminium or
   carbon a fibre reinforced composite are ideal as they provide a lightweight and stiff

                                                14
   tube.    Alternatively the outer wall is produced from a plastic material.     The skilled
   person will be aware that there are other materials that would provide similar benefits.
   In order that the handle 20 diameter is not overly large for a user, the thickness of the
 5 outer wall 200 is preferably less than 2mm and more preferably less than 1mm thick.
   Ideally the thickness is around 0.7mm. Having a relatively thin outer wall 200 of the
   handle 20 also reduces the weight of the product.
   When you have a high speed motor the noise produced is at high frequencies, some of
10 which can be irritating to the human ear. However, this has an advantage as one is able
   to attenuate the higher frequencies more effectively.
   The handle diameter is ideally between 20 and 60 mm and is preferably between 30 and
   50mm.     Most preferably, the handle diameter is between 35 and 42mm. In order to
15 maximise the mitigation of noise and provide a grippable handle, the inventors have
   used a combination of materials in the handle 20. Firstly the outer layer 200 which is
   rigid but also thin so that the sound attenuation within the handle 20 by the silencing
   media namely lining material 270 can be maximised by maximising the thickness of the
   lining material 270 within the handle 20. Ideally at least 6mm of lining material 270 or
20 silencing media is required to attenuate the higher frequency noises (typically around
    1.8 to 2Khz) produced by a high speed motor.
   Referring now to Figure 7, the length of the lining material 270 is also important.
   Ideally there is lining material 270 both upstream of and downstream of the motor 70;
25 this is because the motor generates noise when fluid enters the motor and when fluid
   exits the motor.
   Referring now to Figure 10 which shows a graph of noise produced by the high speed
   motor within a handle 20 in relation to the distance of the fan unit 70 from the inlet 40.
30 Generally, the longer the length of the lining silencing material the more sound is
   attenuated but, there is a limit to how long a product can be and still be practical. Thus

                                                 15
   for a hairdryer having a motor in the handle 20 there is an optimum position between for
   the motor within the length of a handle from a noise perspective. The longer the inlet
   silencer the more noise is attenuated as can be seen on the graph as the motor moves
   away from the inlet, along the x-axis the inlet 280 noise decreases.          However, for a
 5 given handle length lh the longer the inlet silencer Si the shorter the outlet silencer So
   must be.
   For the outlet silencer So if the motor is located at the inlet (the zero value of the x-axis)
   the outlet noise level 282 for the outlet silencer So is minimised for a given handle
10 length lh then, as the motor moves along the handle the outlet silencer So reduces in
   length and the noise attenuation decreases so the sound level rises. There is therefore an
   optimum distance for the motor from the inlet. In the amplifying hairdryer where the
   primary fluid flow path 400 flows from the handle 20 into the body 30 there is a change
   in the shape and size of the primary fluid flow path from a circular cross section 400a
15 within the handle to an annular or doughnut cross section 400b within the body. For
   this reason the inlet and outlet silencers within the handle are not equal from a sound
   perspective as some of the noise created by fluid exiting the motor is attenuated by the
   fluid passing into the body 30.
20 The combined noise output 284 from both the inlet silencer Si and the outlet silencer So
   is the compressor value on the graph which decreases initially as the motor is moved
   away from the inlet to reach a sweet point where the noise levels of the inlet silencer Si
   and the outlet silencer So cross before rising again.
25 The total noise output 288 for the hairdryer is the addition of the compressor value 284
   and the amplifier value 286 which is the noise produced within the body 30 of the
   hairdryer and this value is unaffected by the position of the motor within the handle 20.
   For this particular hairdryer 10, the optimum inlet silencer Si is 70 to I 00mm. However,
   if for example any of the motor speed, the diameter of the handle, or inlet features is
30 changed, this value will change.

                                                 16
   It is preferred that the length of the outlet silencer So from the downstream end 70b of
   the fan unit 70 to the downstream end 22 of the handle 20 is up to 100mm long. It is
   preferred that the inlet silencer Si from the upstream end 70a of the fan unit to the
   downstream end 40b of the inlet 40 is 10 -200mm long. It is preferred that the ratio
 5 between the inlet silencer Si and the outlet silencer So is greater than 1.2. In a hairdryer
   10 having a constant diameter handle 20, the ratio is preferably greater than 0.1.
   Referring now to Figures 5, 11 a to I1d, the hairdiyer 10 has a relationship between the
   diameter da of the outer wall 360 of the body 30 and the diameter db of the inner duct
10 310. The ratio of db: da is preferably between 0.49 and 0.6 in a hairdryer 10 having a
   constant diameter handle 20 as show in Figures 1 Ic and I1d. The ratio of db: da is
   preferably between 0.4 and 0.9 in a hairdryer 130 having a non constant or varying
   diameter handle 132 as shown in Figures 1 la and 11b.
15 Referring now in particular to Figure 12, the relationship between the length Lx of the
   body 30 from the fluid inlet 320 to an upstream edge 202 of the handle 20 and the
   length Lz of the body 30 from a downstream edge 204 of the handle 20 to the fluid
   outlet 340 at the downstream end of the body 30 has a relationship. Ideally Lz < 40mm
   and Lx < 20mm. Preferably, 2Lx=Lz.
20
   Referring now to Figures 13a and 13b hairdryers 132, 134 have a relationship between
   the length 12 of the body 30 and the diameter dh of the handle 20. The ratio of 12: dh is
   preferably between 1.9 and 2.5 in a hairdryer 10 having a constant diameter handle 20.
   The ratio of 12: dh is preferably between 1.9 and 2.5 in a hairdryer 160, 162 having a non
25 constant or varying diameter handle 164 as shown in Figures 13c and 13d.
   Referring now to Figures 14a and 14b, hairdryers 136,138 have a relationship between
   the diameter da of the outer wall 360 of the body 30 and the diameter dh of the handle
   20.   The ratio of da: dh is preferably between 1.6 and 3.4 in a hairdryer 10 having a
30 constant diameter handle 20.

                                                 17
   Referring now to Figures 15a to 15c, hairdryers 140 and 142 have a relationship
   between the length 12 of the body 30 and the diameter da of the body 30. The ratio of 12:
   da is preferably between 1.1 and 1.6 in a hairdryer 10 having a fan unit 70 in the handle
   20. For a hairdiyer 144 where the heater 80 is in the body 30 and the fan unit 70 in the
 5 handle 20 as shown in Figure 15c, the ratio of 12: da is preferably between 0.8 and 1.6.
   Referring now to Figures 16a to 16c hairdryers 146, 148 have a relationship between the
   length 12 of the body 30 and the diameter db of the inner duct 310. The ratio of 12: db is
   preferably between 1.8 and 3.4. Referring now to Figures l6cd to 16f, for hairdryers
10 150, 152 where the heater 80 is in the body 30 and the fan unit 70 in the handle 20, the
   ratio of 12: da is preferably between I and 3.4.
   Another feature of the invention is that the flow in the primary fluid flow path 400b in
   the body 30 is at 900 to the flow in the primary fluid flow path 400a in the handle 20.
15 The primary fluid flow within the body 30 is parallel with the fluid that flows through
   the fluid flow path 300.
   Referring now to Figures 2, 3 b and 9, the inner duct 310 has a generally tubular part 312
   extending from the fluid outlet 340 towards the fluid inlet 320 and a generally conical
20 part 314 that forms a side wall 350 that connects between the generally tubular part 312
   and the outer wall 360 of the body 30.
   The side wall 352 could be orthogonal to the outer wall 360 as shown in Figure 17a.
   Indeed, a separate side wall 350, 352 could be dispensed with and the inner duct 354
25 could extend from the fluid inlet 320 as a cylinder with gradually decreasing diameter
   towards the fluid outlet 340, in the form of a truncated cone.
   Referring to Figure 18a, the inner duct 354a extends from the outer wall 360 at the first
   end 32 and curves towards a tube forming a circular duct at the second end 36. The
30 form generated by inner duct 354a is trumpet shaped. Figure 18b shows a similar inner

                                                 18
   duct 354b to that of Figure 18a however the cone part 358 of the inner duct 354b is
   shorter giving a steeper gradient to the fluid inlet 320.
   The gradually curving inner duct has benefits in that noise is reduced as there is less
 5 turbulence created as fluid enters the fluid flow path at the fluid inlet 320. Having a
   curved side wall is acoustically beneficial as flow entrained into the fluid flow path 300
   does not encounter any sharp corner which would introduce eddies and increase the
   generation of noise. The side wall is blended into the tubular part of the inner duct 310
10 Figure 18c shows a combination of the inner duct 354a of Figure 18a and a flared bore
   354c. The inner duct extends 362 from the first end 32 to a transition point 364 where
   the cylinder with gradually decreasing diameter changes to slightly increase in diameter
   towards the second end 34. This flaring of the inner duct increases entrainment of fluid
   into the fluid inlet 320.
15
   Figure 18d shows a combination of the cone part 358 of Figure 18b and a flared inner
   duct 354d. By having a shorter cone region of the inner duct 354d, the flare can be
   longer.
20 In fact any angle between 1 and 900 could be selected for the angle    P between the outer
   wall 360 and the inner duct 350, 354a, 354b, 354c and 354d.
   Referring to Figures 18c and 18d in particular, the radius r between the conical part
   358,362 and the tubular part 312 of the inner duct 354d, 354c can be varied. The radius
25 preferably lies between 0.5 and 50mm.
   Alternatively, the inner duct 310 could increase in diameter from the side wall 366
   towards the fluid outlet 340, as is shown in Figures 17b and 17c. This is advantageous
   because it increases the entrained flow through the fluid flow path 300. Thus, either the
30 total emission of fluid from the fluid outlet 340 and the primary fluid outlet 440 is
   increased, of the fan unit can be run at slower speeds to produce an equivalent total

                                                 19
   output, reducing noise of the product. The increase in diameter of the inner duct 310 is
   more pronounced in Figure 17c which results in more entrainment through the inner
   duct 3 10.
 5 Referring now to Figure 7, the length of the lining material within the handle 20 can be
   varied. It is preferred that the length of the inlet lining Si from the downstream end 40b
   of the inlet 40 to the upstream end 70a of the fan unit 70 is between 10 and 200mm.
   The front part 38 (Figure 2) of the hairdryer can have various chamfers 372, 374, 376 as
10 shown in Figures 1,2, 6, 19a and 19b the front chamfer 372, 374, 376 is a change in the
   diameter of the outer wall 360 of the body 30. The diameter decreases towards the
   centre A-A of the outer wall 360. The front chamfer 372, 374, 376 influences external
   entrainment 490 from outside the hairdryer due to movement of fluid from the primary
   outlet 440. A blunt front face for the body 30 would restrict flow both for the external
15 entrainment 490 and for flow through the fluid flow path 300. Ideally a front chamfer
   of between 300 as shown in Figure 19a and 600 as shown in Figure 19b is selected.
   Preferably, a front chamfer of 35 to 550 and more preferably, a front chamfer of 45' is
   provided as this provides a reasonable amount of external entrainment 490.
20 The direction of flow exiting the primary fluid outlet is variable depending on the
   desired outcome.     Figures 20a, 20b and 20c show different air exits for the primary
   fluid. Referring firstly to Figure 20a, the primary fluid outlet 440 has first 442 and
   second 444 substantially parallel surfaces defining and outer annular limit and an inner
   annular limit respectively for the primary fluid outlet 440. The first 442 and second 444
25 substantially parallel surfaces are additionally substantially parallel with the inner duct
   310. This arrangement provides a balance between externally entrained flow 490 and
   internally entrained fluid 492 namely that which is drawn into the fluid flow path 300.
   In Figure 20b, the primary fluid outlet 440a is directed towards the centre of the outer
30 wall 360 of the body 30. In this example, both the first 446 and the second 448 surfaces
   that define the primary fluid outlet 440a are substantially parallel to each other but are

                                               20
   inclined to the inner duct 310. The primary fluid outlet 440a is directed towards the
   inner duct 310 and the centre of the outer body 360.      Fluid 494 that exits the primary
   fluid outlet 440a is directed towards fluid emitted from the fluid outlet 340 as is the
   externally entrained fluid 490.      This gives a more concentrated output from the
 5 hairdryer as the fluid is all directed towards the internally entrained fluid flowing
   through the inner duct 310 thus, the hairdryer will feel more powerful as the fluid jet
   emitted from the hairdryer is concentrated into a smaller cross sectional area.       This
   arrangement will give relatively more externally entrained flow 490 and less internally
   entrained flow within the inner duct 310 than the non-inclined example described with
10 reference to Figure 20a.
   Figure 20c the primary fluid outlet 440b is directed away from the centre of the outer
   wall 360 of the body 30. In this example, both the first 450 and the second 452 surfaces
   that define the primary fluid outlet 440a are substantially parallel to each other but are
15 inclined away from the inner duct 310.        The primary fluid outlet 440b is directed
   towards the outer wall 360.       Fluid 496 that exits the primary fluid outlet 440b is
   directed away from fluid emitted from the fluid outlet 340 and towards the externally
   entrained fluid 490. This gives a more diffuse output from the hairdryer as the fluid is
   all directed outwardly thus, the hairdryer will feel less powerful as the fluid jet emitted
20 from the hairdryer is spread into a larger cross sectional area. . This arrangement will
   give relatively less externally entrained flow 490 and relatively more internally
   entrained flow along the inner duct 310 than the non-inclined example described with
   reference to Figure 20a.
25 Figure 21 shows the easy accessibility of the controlling buttons of the hairdryer 10 and
   the ergonomic benefit of positioning control buttons 64 (See Figure 2) on an angled
   surface of the body of the hairdryer. When a hairdryer is gripped normally by a hand
   500, conventionally the thumb would be positioned around the handle forming a whole
   or partial circle with the index finger 502. In the present hairdryer 10 the thumb 504
30 may grip conventionally, but the thumb is also operable to change settings such as
   temperature and/or flow through the hairdiyer by the control buttons 64 located on the

                                                  21
   side wall 350 which forms part of the fluid inlet 320 at the rear of the product. Thus
   without adjusting the grip, apart from perhaps moving the thumb radially from the
   handle 20 to the side wall 350 a user can change the settings of the hairdryer 10. The
   side wall 350 is preferably angled to the outer wall 360 of the body 390. This angle y is
 5 ideally between 1 and 90' and preferably between 30 and 60'. An angle y of 450 is
   most preferred.
   Figure 22 shows a graph of the velocity profile through hairdryer 10. At the fluid inlet
   40, fluid entering the fluid inlet 40 is at a relatively low velocity 402, as the fluid passes
10 through the inlet silencer the velocity 404 increases as the cross sectional area within the
   handle 20 decreases.     Also, as the fluid enters the fan unit the velocity 406 increases
   again due to further restriction of the fluid flow path 400 through the motor and impeller
   of the fan unit 70 upstream of the fan unit 70 the velocity 408 decreases through the
   outlet silencer as the fluid flow path becomes less restrictive again.           A minimum
15 velocity 410 is reached when the fluid passes from the handle 20 into the body 30 of the
   hairdryer 10.    This is because the body 30 has a larger cross sectional area than the
   handle and acts as a plenum which fills up with fluid slowing the fluid down. Within
   the body the velocity 410 is similar to that at the inlet 402.        When the fluid passes
   through the heater 80 the velocity 412 increases slightly as the heater element provides a
20 small restriction to the flow of the fluid. As the fluid nears the primary fluid outlet 440
   the cross sectional area within the body 30 reduces to an annular ring which defines the
   primary fluid outlet 440, the velocity within the body increases to a maximum velocity
   414 at the primary fluid outlet 440.
25 Having the velocity decrease as the fluid moves from the fan unit 70 to the heater 80 has
   a number of advantages: the body 30 acts like a plenum which stabilises the flow as it
   moves from a circular flow 400a within the handle 20 to an annular flow 400b within
   the body 30 this slows the fluid down enables a more even flow through the heater 80
   so velocity and turbulence are reduced; the noise produced by the hairdryer is reduced;
30 there is more even loading around the annular ring that forms the primary fluid outlet
   440.

                                                 22
   The main reason the velocity reduces from a fan unit velocity 406 to a heater velocity
   412 is that the cross section area of the fluid flow path changes from area A1 in the
   circular flow 400a within the handle to an cross sectional area A2 in the annular flow
   400b within the body 30, this is shown schematically in Figure 22b, A2 > Ai.
   Although the outer wall 200 of the handle 20 has been described as being made from a
   rolled sheet of metal, alternatives methods of manufacture and materials could be used;
   these include, but are not limited to, an extruded tube and a plastic extrusion/moulded
   tube or a composite tube such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic.
10
   The invention has been described in detail with respect to a hairdryer however, it is
   applicable to any appliance that draws in a fluid and directs the outflow of that fluid
   from the appliance.
15 The appliance can be used with or without a heater; the action of the outflow of fluid at
   high velocity has a drying effect.
   The fluid that flows through the appliance is generally air, but may be a different
   combination of gases or gas and can include additives to improve performance of the
20 appliance or the impact the appliance has on an object the output is directed at for
   example, hair and the styling of that hair.
   The invention is not limited to the detailed description given above. Variations will be
   apparent to the person skilled in the art.
