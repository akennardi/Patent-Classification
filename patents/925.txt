                                              ABSTRACT
        An adaptive therapy delivery system can receive imaging information including a
volumetric image comprising a target such as a tumor or one or more other structures, and
can receive imaging information corresponding to one or more imaging slices comprising
different portions of the target, such as imaging slices acquired at different times after
acquisition of the volumetric image. The system can spatially register information from an
earlier-acquired image with a portion of the target included in a later-acquired one of the
imaging slices. The system can then determine an updated location of the target indicated by
the spatially-registered information. Using the updated location, the system can generate an
updated therapy protocol to control delivery of a therapy beam.

                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
 15            This disclosure generally relates to radiation therapy or radiotherapy.
       More specifically, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for adapting a
       radiation therapy treatment plan in order to compensate for changes in a position
       of a target tumor during the delivery of radiation therapy.
 20                                       BACKGROUND
               Radiation therapy or "radiotherapy" can be used to treat cancers or other
       ailments in mammalian (e.g., human and animal) tissue. One such radiotherapy
       technique is a Gamma Knife, by which a patient is irradiated by a large number
       of low-intensity gamma rays that converge with high intensity and high
 25    precision at a target (e.g., a tumor). In another embodiment, radiotherapy is
       provided using a linear accelerator, whereby a tumor is irradiated by high-energy
       particles (e.g., electrons, protons, ions, high-energy photons, and the like). The
       placement and dose of the radiation beam must be accurately controlled to
       ensure the tumor receives the prescribed radiation, and the placement of the
 30    beam should be such as to minimize damage to the surrounding healthy tissue,
       often called the organ(s) at risk (OARs). Radiation is termed "prescribed"
                                                   1

WO 2016/069633                                                                PCT/US2015/057633
       because a physician orders a predefined amount of radiation to the tumor and
       surrounding organs similar to a prescription for medicine.
                Generally, ionizing radiation in the form of a collimated beam is directed
       from an external radiation source toward a patient.
  5             A specified or selectable beam energy can be used, such as for delivering
       a diagnostic energy level range or a therapeutic energy level range. Modulation
       of a radiation beam can be provided by one or more attenuators or collimators
       (e.g., a multi-leaf collimator). The intensity and shape of the radiation beam can
       be adjusted by collimation avoid damaging healthy tissue (e.g., organs at risk)
 10    adjacent to the targeted tissue by conforming the projected beam to a profile of
       the targeted tissue.
                The treatment planning procedure may include using a three-dimensional
       image of the patient to identify a target region (e.g., the tumor) and to identify
       critical organs near the tumor. Creation of a treatment plan can be a time
 15    consuming process where a planner tries to comply with various treatment
       objectives or constraints (e.g., dose volume histogram (DVH) objectives), taking
       into account their individual importance (e.g., weighting) in order to produce a
       treatment plan that is clinically acceptable. This task can be a time-consuming
       trial-and-error process that is complicated by the various organs at risk (OARs)
 20    because as the number of OARs increases (e.g., up to thirteen for a head-and
       neck treatment), so does the complexity of the process. OARs distant from a
       tumor may be easily spared from radiation, while OARs close to or overlapping
       a target tumor may be difficult to spare.
                Traditionally, for each patient, the initial treatment plan can be generated
 25    in an "offline" manner. The treatment plan can be developed well before
       radiation therapy is delivered, such as using one or more medical imaging
       techniques. Imaging information can include, for example, images from X-rays,
       Computed Tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (MR), positron
       emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography
 30    (SPECT), or ultrasound. A health care provider, such as a physician, may use
                                                   2

       three-dimensional imaging information indicative of the patient anatomy to
       identify one or more target tumors along with the organs at risk near the tumor.
       The health care provider can delineate the target tumor that is to receive a
       prescribed radiation dose using a manual technique, and the health care provider
  5    can similarly delineate nearby tissue, such as organs, at risk of damage from the
       radiation treatment. Alternatively or additionally, an automated tool (e.g.,
       ABAS provided by Elekta AB, Sweden) can be used to assist in identifying or
       delineating the target tumor and organs at risk. A radiation therapy treatment
       plan ("treatment plan") can then be created using an optimization technique
 10    based on clinical and dosimetric objectives and constraints (e.g., the maximum,
       minimum, and mean doses of radiation to the tumor and critical organs).
                The treatment planning procedure may include using a three-dimensional
       image of the patient to identify a target region (e.g., the tumor) and to identify
       critical organs near the tumor. Creation of a treatment plan can be a time
 15    consuming process where a planner tries to comply with various treatment
       objectives or constraints (e.g., dose volume histogram (DVH) objectives), taking
       into account their individual importance (e.g., weighting) in order to produce a
       treatment plan that is clinically acceptable. This task can be a time-consuming
       trial-and-error process that is complicated by the various organs at risk (OARs)
 20    because as the number of OARs increases (e.g., up to thirteen for a head-and
       neck treatment), so does the complexity of the process. OARs distant from a
       tumor may be easily spared from radiation, while OARs close to or overlapping
       a target tumor may be difficult to spare.
                The treatment plan can then be later executed by positioning the patient
 25    and delivering the prescribed radiation therapy. The radiation therapy treatment
       plan can include dose "fractioning," whereby a sequence of radiation therapy
       deliveries are provided over a predetermined period of time (e.g., 45 fractions),
       with each therapy delivery including a specified fraction of a total prescribed
       dose. However, during treatment the position of the patient and the position of
 30    the target tumor in relation to the treatment machine (e.g., linear accerator
                                                  3

       "linac") is very important in order to ensure the target tumor and not healthy
       tissue is irradiated.
                                           OVERVIEW
  5             The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that a
       radiation therapy treatment plan can be adjusted contemporaneously in an
       adaptive manner in order to compensate for changes in a position of a target
       tumor during the delivery or radiation therapy to the tumor. For example, a
       desired target, such as a tumor, can shift in position to such an extent that if an
 10    exclusively "offline" approach to therapy planning is used, a location of the
       tumor indicated by medical images taken prior to treatment can be significantly
       different from the location of the tumor target during radiation therapy treatment.
       For example, the tumor may shrink, may move, or can be misaligned compared
       to the expected or desired location as indicated in the treatment plan. Motion of
 15    the target can be caused by one or more sources, such as heart motion,
       respiration, a reflex such as a cough, or other movements. Therefore, the
       position of where radiation therapy should be delivered based on images taken
       prior to treatment can be significantly misaligned with the desired target when
       the radiation therapy is eventually delivered. Hereinafter, a "target locus" is a
 20    location of the target such as prior to treatment, and "a therapy locus" is a
       location where radiation therapy is delivered during treatment (and ideally is
       aligned with the actual location of the target at the time of radiation therapy
       delivery).
                In one approach, imaging can be performed contemporaneously with the
 25    delivery of a radiation therapy, such as performing an imaging acquisition
       immediately before initiating radiation therapy delivery during a treatment
       session, or using a sequence of respective therapy delivery followed by
       immediately acquiring one or more images of the tumor during a radiation
       therapy delivery session. Such imaging can provide information helpful for
 30    identifying a position of the target or for identifying the motion of the target.
                                                  4

WO 2016/069633                                                               PCT/US2015/057633
       Such contemporaneous imaging can be referred to generically as "real-time," but
       in general a latency or time delay exists between an acquisition of an image and
       a delivery of radiation therapy, which is generally on the order of about 100 to
       500 milliseconds (ms).
  5             A problem exists if an acquisition latency or imaging acquisition rate of
       three-dimensional volumetric imaging information is unacceptable (e.g., imaging
       acquisition is too slow to permit therapy guidance or control, such as greater
       than about 500 ms for respiratory targets). The subject matter described herein
       can address such a problem, such as by facilitating more rapid acquisition of
 10    imaging slices (including one or more of one-dimensional profiles, two
       dimensional slices, or three-dimensional volumes comprising a sub-volume or
       sub-region of an earlier-imaged volumetric region), including comparing
       information indicative of a portion of the target locus obtained rapidly from one
       or more imaging slices to information obtained from an earlier-acquired
 15    volumetric reference image.
                In an example, an adaptive image-guided therapy delivery system can
       receive imaging information including a volumetric image comprising a target
       within a radiation therapy patient, and can receive imaging information
       corresponding to one or more imaging slices comprising different portions of the
       target, the imaging slices acquired at different instants after acquisition of the
       volumetric image.
                According to various examples, the system can spatially register
       information indicative of a portion of the target from at least one of the imaging
       slices acquired earlier as well as spatially registering a portion of the target from
       at least one of the imaging slices acquired at a later time. The system can then
       determine a difference between a location of the target indicated by the spatially
       registered information and an earlier location of the target indicated by the
       earlier-acquired volumetric image. The system can then generate an updated
       therapy protocol to control delivery of a therapy beam based on the determined
       difference in the position of the target.

                In another example, a portion or entirety of a volumetric reference image
       can be spatially registered with one or more imaging slices, such as to determine
       an optimal shift between the volumetric reference image and one or more
       imaging slices. For example, the volumetric reference image can include three
       dimensional imaging information (e.g., grayscale or contrast values
       corresponding to voxels), and the three-dimensional imaging information can be
       translated or rotated to achieve an optimal registration with one or more imaging
       slices (e.g., two-dimensional imaging information). A goodness-of-fit between
       the shifted or rotated three-dimensional volumetric imaging information and one
       or more imaging slices can include use of one or more metrics, without requiring
       segmentation of the target.
                An updated therapy protocol can be generated in an adaptive manner to
       align the therapy locus established by the therapy beam with an updated target
       locus or to gate the beam, so that the therapy is delivered when the therapy locus
       passes through the target locus. Updating a therapy protocol can include one or
  5    more of (a) adjustment of actuators coupled to a moveable platform such as a
       couch or table supporting the therapy recipient, (b) adjustment of one or more
       apertures configured to collimate or shape the therapy beam, (c) adjustment of
       one or more actuators configured to position a therapy output to establish a
       specified therapy beam direction, or (d) gating of therapy delivery such as using
 10    obtained imaging or information from other sensors, as illustrative examples.

       present patent application. It is not intended to provide an exclusive or
       exhaustive explanation of the invention. The detailed description is included to

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                FIG. 1A illustrates generally an example of a radiation therapy system
       102 that can include radiation therapy output 104 configured to provide a
       therapy beam 108. The radiation therapy output 104 can include one or more
 20    attenuators or collimators, such as a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) as described in
       the illustrative example of FIG. 2. Referring back to FIG. 1A, a patient can be
       positioned in a region 112, such as on a platform 116 (e.g., a table or a couch), to
       receive a radiation therapy dose according to a radiation therapy treatment plan.
       The radiation therapy output 104 can be located on a gantry 106 or other
 25    mechanical support, such as to rotate the therapy output 104 around an axis
       ("A"). One or more of the platform 116 or the radiation therapy output 104 can
       be moveable to other locations, such as moveable in transverse direction ("T") or
       a lateral direction ("L").   Other degrees of freedom are possible, such as rotation
       about one or more other axes, such as rotation about a transverse axis (indicated
 30    as "R").
                                                  9

WO 2016/069633                                                             PCT/US2015/057633
                The coordinate system (including axes A, T, and L) shown in FIG. 1A
       can have an origin located at an isocenter 110. The isocenter can be defined as a
       location where the radiation therapy beam 108 intersects the origin of a
       coordinate axis, such as to deliver a prescribed radiation dose to a location on or
  5    within a patient. For example, the isocenter 110 can be defined as a location
       where the radiation therapy beam 108 intersects the patient for various rotational
       positions of the radiation therapy output 104 as positioned by the gantry 106
       around the axis A.
                In an example, a detector 114 can be located within a field of the therapy
 10    beam 108, such as can include a flat panel detector (e.g., a direct detector or a
       scintillation-based detector). The detector 114 can be mounted on the gantry
       106 opposite the radiation therapy output 104, such as to maintain alignment
       with the therapy beam 108 as the gantry 106 rotates. In this manner, the detector
       114 can be used to monitor the therapy beam 108 or the detector can be used 114
 15    for imaging, such as portal imaging.
                In an illustrative example, one or more of the platform 116, the therapy
       output 104, or the gantry 106 can be automatically positioned, and the therapy
       output 104 can establish the therapy beam 108 according to a specified dose for
       a particular therapy delivery instance. A sequence of therapy deliveries can be
 20    specified according to a radiation therapy treatment plan, such as using one or
       more different orientations or locations of the gantry 106, platform 116, or
       therapy output 104. The therapy deliveries can occur sequentially, but can
       intersect in a desired therapy locus on or within the patient, such as at the
       isocenter 110. A prescribed cumulative dose of radiation therapy can thereby be
 25    delivered to the therapy locus while damage to tissue nearby the therapy locus is
       reduced or avoided.
                As mentioned in relation to other examples herein, the radiation therapy
       system 102 can include or can be coupled to an imaging acquisition system, such
       as to provide one or more of nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, X-ray
 30    imaging, such as can include computed tomography (CT) imaging, or ultrasound
                                                 10

WO 2016/069633                                                             PCT/US2015/057633
       imaging. In an example, MR imaging information or other imaging information
       can be used to generate imaging information or visualizations equivalent to CT
       imaging, without requiring actual CT imaging. Such imaging can be referred to
       as "pseudo-CT" imaging.
  5            FIG. 1B illustrates generally another example of a radiation therapy
       system 102 (e.g., Leksell Gamma Knife manufactured by Elekta, AB,
       Stockholm, Sweden), according to some embodiments of the present
       disclosure. As shown in Fig. 1B, in a radiation therapy treatment session, a
       patient 152 may wear a coordinate frame 154 to stabilize a portion of the
 10    patient's anatomy (e.g., the head) undergoing surgery or radiation
       therapy. Coordinate frame 154 and a patient positioning system 156 may
       establish a spatial coordinate system, which may be used while imaging a patient
       or during radiation surgery.
               Radiation therapy device 102 may include a protective housing 164 to
 15    enclose a plurality of radiation sources 162. Radiation sources 162 may generate
       a plurality of radiation beams (e.g., beamlets) through beam channels 166. The
       plurality of radiation beams may be configured to focus on an isocenter 158
       from different directions. While each individual radiation beam may have a
       relatively low intensity, isocenter 158 may receive a relatively high level of
 20    radiation when multiple doses from different radiation beams accumulate at
       isocenter 158. In certain embodiments, isocenter 158 may correspond to a target
       under surgery or treatment, such as a tumor.
               FIG. 1C illustrates generally an example of a system that can include a
       combined radiation therapy system 102 and an imaging system, such as can
 25    include a computed tomography (CT) imaging system. The CT imaging system
       can include an imaging X-ray source 118, such as providing X-ray energy in a
       kiloelectron-Volt (keV) energy range. The imaging X-ray source 118 provides
       one or more of fan-shaped or conical beam 120 directed to an imaging detector
       122, such as a flat panel detector. The radiation therapy system 102 can be
 30    similar to the system 102 described in relation to FIG. 1A, such as including a
                                                11

WO 2016/069633                                                               PCT/US2015/057633
       radiation therapy output 104, a gantry 106, a platform 116, and another flat panel
       detector 114. As in the examples of FIG. 1A, FIG. 1B, and FIG. 1D, the
       radiation therapy system 102 can be coupled to, or can include, a high-energy
       accelerator configured to provide a therapeutic radiation beam. The X-ray source
  5    118 can provide a comparatively-lower-energy X-ray diagnostic beam, for
       imaging.
                In the illustrative example of FIG. 1C, the radiation therapy output 104
       and the X-ray source 118 can be mounted on the same rotating gantry 106,
       rotationally-separated from each other by 90 degrees. In another example, two
 10    or more X-ray sources can be mounted along the circumference of the gantry
       106, such as each having its own detector arrangement to provide multiple
       angles of diagnostic imaging concurrently. Similarly, multiple radiation therapy
       outputs 104 can be provided.
                FIG. 1D illustrates generally a partially cut-away view of an example of
 15    a system that can include a combined radiation therapy system 102 and an
       imaging system, such as can include a nuclear magnetic resonance (MR)
       imaging system 130. The MR imaging system 130 can be arranged to define a
       "bore" around an axis ("A"), and the radiation therapy system can include a
       radiation therapy output 104, such as to provide a radiation therapy beam 108
 20    directed to an isocenter 110 within the bore along the axis, A. The radiation
       therapy output 104 can include a collimator 124, such as to one or more of
       control, shape, or modulate radiation therapy beam 108 to direct the beam 108 to
       a therapy locus aligned with a desired target locus within a patient. The patient
       can be supported by a platform, such as a platform positionable along one or
 25    more of an axial direction, A, a lateral direction, L, or a transverse direction, T.
       One or more portions of the radiation therapy system 102 can be mounted on a
       gantry 106, such as to rotate the radiation therapy output 104 about the axis A.
                FIG. 1A, FIG. 1B, FIG. 1C, and FIG. 1D illustrate generally examples
       including a configuration where a therapy output can be rotated around a central
 30    axis (e.g., an axis "A"). Other radiation therapy output configurations can be
                                                 12

WO 2016/069633                                                              PCT/US2015/057633
       used. For example, a radiation therapy output can be mounted a robotic arm or
       manipulator, such as having multiple degrees of freedom. In yet another
       example, the therapy output can be fixed, such as located in a region laterally
       separated from the patient, and a platform supporting the patient can be used to
  5    align a radiation therapy isocenter with a specified target locus within the
       patient.
                FIG. 2 illustrates generally an example of a multi-leaf collimator (MLC)
       132, such as can be used to one or more of shape, direct, or modulate an
       intensity of a radiation therapy beam. In FIG. 2, leaves 132A through 132J can
 10    be automatically positioned to define an aperture approximating a tumor 140
       cross section or projection. The leaves 132A through 132J can be made of a
       material specified to attenuate or block the radiation beam in regions other than
       the aperture, in accordance with the radiation treatment plan. For example, the
       leaves 132A through 132J can include metallic plates, such as comprising
 15    tungsten, with a long axis of the plates oriented perpendicular to a beam
       direction, and having ends oriented parallel to the beam direction (as shown in
       the plane of the illustration of FIG. 2). A "state" of the MLC 132 can be
       adjusted adaptively during a course of radiation therapy, such as to establish a
       therapy beam that better approximates a shape or location of the tumor 140 or
 20    other target locus, as compared to using a static collimator configuration or as
       compared to using an MLC 132 configuration determined exclusively using an
       "offline" therapy planning technique. A radiation therapy technique including
       using the MLC 132 to produce a specified radiation dose distribution to a tumor
       or to specific areas within a tumor can be referred to as Intensity Modulated
 25    Radiation Therapy (IMRT).
                FIG. 3 illustrates generally an example of radiation therapy system 300,
       such as can include a radiation therapy device 330 and an imaging acquisition
       device. Radiation therapy system 300 may include a training module 312, a
       prediction module 314, a training database 322, a testing database 324, a
 30    radiation therapy device 330, and an image acquisition device 350. Radiation
                                                  13

       therapy system 300 may also be connected to a treatment planning system (TPS)
       342 and an oncology information system (01S) 344, which may provide patient
       information. In addition, radiation therapy system 300 may include a display
       device and a user interface.
  5            FIG. 4 illustrates generally an example of a system 400 that can be used
       for one or more of imaging acquisition, image segmentation, target prediction,
       therapy control, or therapy adjustment. According to some embodiments,
       system 400 may be one or more high-performance computing devices capable of
       identifying, analyzing, maintaining, generating, or providing large amounts of
 10    data consistent with the disclosed embodiments. System 400 may be standalone,
       or it may be part of a subsystem, which in turn may be part of a larger
       system. For example, system 400 may represent distributed high-performance
       servers that are remotely located and communicate over a network, such as the
       Internet, or a dedicated network, such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide
 15    area network (WAN). In some embodiments, system 400 may include an
       embedded system, imaging scanner (e.g., a nuclear magnetic resonance (MR)
       scanner or other scanner such as a computed tomography (CT) scanner), and/or
       touch-screen display device in communication with one or more remotely
       located high-performance computing devices.
 20            In one embodiment, system 400 may include one or more processors
       414, one or more memories 410, and one or more communication interfaces
       415. Processor 414 may be a processor circuit, including one or more general
       purpose processing devices such as a microprocessor, central processing unit
       (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), or the like. More particularly, processor
 25    414 may be a complex instruction set computing (CISC) microprocessor,
       reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessor, very long instruction
       Word (VLIW) microprocessor, a processor implementing other instruction sets,
       or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets.
               Processor 414 may also be one or more special-purpose processing
 30    devices such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field
                                                 14

       programmable gate array (FPGA), a digital signal processor (DSP), a System
       on-a-Chip (SoC), or the like. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art,
       in some embodiments, processor 414 may be a special-purpose processor, rather
       than a general-purpose processor. Processor 414 may include one or more
  5    known processing devices, such as a microprocessor from the PentiumTM or
       XeonTM family manufactured by JntelTM, the TurionTM family manufactured by
       AMDTM, or any of various processors manufactured by other vendors such as
       OracleTM (e.g., a SPARCTM -architecture processor). Processor 414 may also
       include graphical processing units manufactured by NvidiaTM. The disclosed
 10    embodiments are not limited to any type of processor(s) otherwise configured to
       meet the computing demands of identifying, analyzing, maintaining, generating,
       and/or providing large amounts of imaging data or any other type of data
       consistent with the disclosed embodiments.
               Memory 410 may include one or more storage devices configured to
 15    store computer-executable instructions used by processor 414 to perform
       functions related to the disclosed embodiments. For example, memory 410 may
       store computer executable software instructions for treatment planning software
       411, operating system software 412, and training/prediction software
       413. Processor 414 may be communicatively coupled to the memory/storage
 20    device 410, and the processor 414 may be configured to execute the computer
       executable instructions stored thereon to perform one or more operations
       consistent with the disclosed embodiments. For example, processor 414 may
       execute training/prediction software 413 to implement functionalities of training
       module 312 and prediction module 314. In addition, processor device 414 may
 25    execute treatment planning software 411 (e.g., such as Monaco@ provided by
       Elekta) that may interface with training/prediction software 413.
               The disclosed embodiments are not limited to separate programs or
       computers configured to perform dedicated tasks. For example, memory 410
       may include a single program that performs the functions of the system 400 or
 30    multiple programs (e.g., treatment planning software 411 and/or
                                                15

       training/prediction software 413). Additionally, processor 414 may execute one
       or more programs located remotely from system 400, such as programs stored in
       database 420, such remote programs may include oncology information system
       software or treatment planning software. Memory 410 may also store image
  5    data or any other type of data/information in any format that the system may use
       to perform operations consistent with the disclosed embodiments.
               Communication interface 415 may be one or more devices configured to
       allow data to be received and/or transmitted by system 400. Communication
       interface 415 may include one or more digital and/or analog communication
 10    devices that allow system 400 to communicate with other machines and devices,
       such as remotely located components of system 400, database 420, or hospital
       database 430. For example, Processor 414 may be communicatively connected
       to database(s) 420 or hospital database(s) 430 through communication interface
       415. For example, Communication interface 415 may be a computer network,
 15    such as the Internet, or a dedicated network, such as a LAN or a
       WAN. Alternatively, the communication interface 415 may be a satellite
       communications link or any form of digital or analog communications link that
       allows processor 414 to send/receive data to/from either database(s) 420, 430.
               Database(s) 420 and hospital database(s) 430 may include one or more
 20    memory devices that store information and are accessed and managed through
       system 400. By way of example, database(s) 420, hospital database(s) 530, or
       both may include relational databases such as OracleTM databases, SybaseTM
       databases, or others and may include non-relational databases, such as Hadoop
       sequence files, HBase, Cassandra or others. The databases or other files may
 25    include, for example, one or more of raw data from MR scans or CT scans
       associated with an imaging subject, such as for training or providing a reference
       image, MR feature vectors, CT values, reduced-dimension feature vectors,
       pseudo-CT prediction model(s), pseudo-CT value(s), pseudo-CT image, DICOM
       data, etc. Systems and methods of disclosed embodiments, however, are not
 30    limited to separate databases. In one aspect, system 400 may include database(s)
                                                16

       420 or hospital database(s) 430. Alternatively, database(s) 420 and/or hospital
       database(s) 430 may be located remotely from the system 400. Database(s) 420
       and hospital database(s) 430 may include computing components (e.g., database
       management system, database server, etc.) configured to receive and process
  5    requests for data stored in memory devices of database(s) 420 or hospital
       database(s) 430 and to provide data from database(s) 420 or hospital database(s)
       430.
                System 400 may communicate with other devices and components of
       system 400 over a network (not shown). The network may be any type of
 10    network (including infrastructure) that provides communications, exchanges
       information, or facilitates the exchange of information and enables the sending
       and receiving of information between other devices and/or components of
       system 400 over a network (not shown). In other embodiments, one or more
       components of system 400 may communicate directly through a dedicated
 15    communication link(s), such as a link (e.g., hardwired link, wireless link, or
       satellite link, or other communication link) between system 400 and database(s)
       420 and hospital database(s) 430.
                The configuration and boundaries of the functional building blocks of
       system 400 has been defined herein for the convenience of the
 20    description. Alternative boundaries can be defined so long as the specified
       functions and relationships thereof are appropriately performed. Alternatives
       (including equivalents, extensions, variations, deviations, etc., of those described
       herein) will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the
       teachings contained herein. Such alternatives fall within the scope of the
 25    disclosed embodiments.
                FIG. 5 illustrates generally an example of a system 500, such as can
       include a radiation therapy controller system 554 having an imaging input 560, a
       radiation therapy generator 556, and a radiation therapy output 504. The therapy
       generator 556 can include an accelerator, such as a linear accelerator, or another

       generator 556 to process a beam of energetic photons or particles provided by
       the therapy generator 556. For example, the therapy output 504 can include or
       can be coupled to an output actuator 566 to one or more of rotate or translate the
       therapy output 504 to provide a radiation therapy beam having a therapy locus
  5    directed to a desired target locus. The therapy output 504 can include a
       collimator 564, such as a multi-leaf collimator as mentioned above in relation to
       FIG. 2. Referring back to FIG. 5, the therapy controller system 554 can be
       configured to control one or more of the therapy generator 556, the therapy
       output 504, or a patient position actuator 516 (such as a movable platform
 10    including a couch or table), using an adaptive radiation treatment technique as
       described in other examples herein.
               The therapy controller system 554 can be coupled to one or more
       sensors, such as using a sensor input 562. For example, a patient sensor 558 can
       provide physiologic information to the therapy controller system, such as
 15    information indicative of one or more of respiration (e.g., using a
       plethysmographic sensor), patient cardiac mechanical or electrical activity,
       peripheral circulatory activity, patient position, or patient motion. Such
       information can provide a surrogate signal correlated with motion of one or more
       organs or other regions to be targeted by the therapy output 504, and such
 20    information can be used to control therapy (e.g., for therapy gating).
               The imaging input 560 can be coupled to an imaging system 550 (such as
       can include a computed tomography imaging system, a nuclear magnetic
       resonance (MR) imaging system, or an ultrasound imaging system, as illustrative
       examples). Alternatively, or in addition, the therapy controller system 554 can
 25    receive imaging information from an imaging data store 552, such as a
       centralized imaging database or imaging server. One or more of the therapy
       controller system 554 or the imaging system 550 can include elements shown
       and described in relation to the system 400 shown in FIG. 4.
               FIG. 6 illustrates generally a view of a target locus 616, such as a tumor
 30    region to be treated using radiation therapy. Information indicative of the target

WO 2016/069633                                                              PCT/US2015/057633
       locus 616 can be obtained using a volumetric imaging technique. The
       representation in FIG. 6 is shown has having rectangular facets merely for
       purposes of illustration, and an actual target locus 616 may include curved or
       irregular surfaces. A region of interest 612 can be imaged, such as using one or
  5    more of MR imaging, CT imaging, pseudo-CT image visualization, portal
       imaging, ultrasound imaging, or other techniques. The target locus 616 can be
       identified such as using automated, manual, or semi-automated image
       segmentation techniques. For example, a specified label can be assigned to
       voxels (e.g., a voxel 620) to identify a locus or group of voxels comprising a
 10    radiation therapy target. As an illustrative example, a contrast value for a voxel
       620 can be compared to adjacent voxels, and an edge of a tumor or other region
       can be identified such as using contrast information. Other regions can also be
       identified such as nearby organs or locations of other features.
                Various features of the target locus can be determined such as one or
 15    more edge locations (e.g., using an edge detection or edge identification
       technique). For example, a position of the target locus 616 can be identified by
       determining a spatial centroid 608 of the target locus 616. The use of a centroid
       608 as an extracted feature is illustrative and other features can be used for
       tracking target locus 616 motion, such as a manually-identified or automatically
 20    determined location of a point, surface, or edge of the target locus 616. In yet
       another example, an implantable or external seed fiducial can be used, such as
       providing an indicium in obtained imaging information.
                The target locus 616 and one or more corresponding features such as the
       centroid 608 can be identified during treatment planning imaging, such as inter
 25    fractionally (e.g., between radiation therapy delivery sessions) or just prior to
       beginning a radiation therapy delivery session. Volumetric imaging information
       comprising the target locus 616 can be referred to as a "reference image." As
       mentioned above, a challenge can exist because image acquisition and
       processing latency may preclude "real time" acquisition of volumetric imaging
 30    information during radiation treatment. Accordingly, intra-fractional image
                                                  19

WO 2016/069633                                                               PCT/US2015/057633
       acquisition (such as during or between radiation therapy deliveries in a radiation
       therapy session) can include more rapid acquisition of imaging slices (including
       one or more of one-dimensional profiles, two-dimensional slices, or three
       dimensional volumes comprising a sub-volume or sub-region of an earlier
  5    imaged volumetric region). Information indicative of a portion of the target locus
       obtained rapidly from one or more imaging slices can be compared to
       information obtained from an earlier-acquired volumetric reference image to
       update a therapy protocol, such as to adjust therapy due to movement of the
       target locus. The imaging modality used for obtaining or generating the
 10    volumetric reference image need not be the same as is used for intra-fractional
       imaging.
               In another example, the target locus 616 need not be segmented or
       otherwise identified in the volumetric reference image. Use of the phrase "target
       locus" is merely illustrative of a target within the region of interest such as a
 15    portion or an entirety of a tumor to be treated or other anatomical structures such
       as organs near the tumor. In addition to, or instead of segmentation of the target
       locus 616, various techniques as described herein can be performed such as
       including spatially registering a portion of the volumetric reference image (e.g.,
       a specified region of interest) or an entirety of the volumetric reference image
 20    with other imaging information such as using voxel values including contrast or
       grayscale values. For example, such spatial registration can include three
       dimensional (e.g. volumetric) registration with one or more two-dimensional
       imaging slices (e.g., 3D-to-2D registration), or other techniques.
                FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B illustrate views of an imaging acquisition plane
 25    712A (in FIG. 7A) of a target locus 716 and a corresponding acquired imaging
       slice 714A (in FIG. 7B) corresponding to a first imaging plane orientation
       intersecting the target locus 716 along a line 706A. As an illustrative example,
       FIG. 7A can represent a sagittal orientation of the image acquisition plane 712A
       and corresponding slice 714A. An imaging "slice" can include two-dimensional
 30    pixel imaging information or three-dimensional imaging information, such as
                                                 20

WO 2016/069633                                                             PCT/US2015/057633
       having a small finite thickness as shown illustratively in FIG. 7B. A portion
       718A of the target locus in the imaging slice 714A can be identified, such as
       again using a segmentation technique, for example using a discrete dynamic
       contour, snake, or level set, or a registration-based technique.
  5             A series of imaging slices can be obtained, such as including different
       imaging acquisition plane orientations as shown in FIG. 7C, FIG. 7D, FIG. 7E,
       and FIG. 7F. For example, FIG. 7C and FIG. 7D illustrate views of an imaging
       acquisition plane 712B (in FIG. 7C) intersecting the target locus 716 along a line
       706B and a corresponding acquired imaging slice 714B (in FIG. 7D) including a
 10    different portion 718B of the target locus 716, corresponding to a second
       imaging plane orientation, such as can be orthogonal to the first imaging plane
       orientation mentioned above in relation to FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B. As an
       illustration, FIG. 7C and FIG. 7D can correspond to a coronal plane. FIG. 7E
       and FIG. 7F illustrate views of an imaging acquisition plane 712C (in FIG. 7E)
 15    intersecting the target locus 716 along a line 706C and a corresponding acquired
       imaging slice 714C (in FIG. 7F) including yet another different portion 718C of
       the target locus 716, corresponding to a third imaging plane orientation, such as
       can be orthogonal to one or more of the first and second imaging plane
       orientations mentioned above in relation to FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. 7C, and FIG.
 20    7D. As an illustration, FIG. 7E and FIG. 7F can correspond to an axial imaging
       plane. The imaging slices of FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. 7C, FIG. 7D, FIG. 7E, and
       FIG. 7F are shown as two-dimensional planes that are orthogonal to each other.
       However, as mentioned in relation to other examples herein, the slices need not
       be planar nor orthogonal. Each acquired imaging slice can be processed,
 25    including processing of one or more slices in parallel with an acquisition of an
       imaging slice. For example, such processing can include sampled information
       from a volumetric reference image, such as corresponding to a plane or region of
       the acquired imaging slice.
                In one approach, a feature extracted from one or more of the imaging
 30    slices 714A, 714B, or 714C can be compared with imaging information
                                                  21

WO 2016/069633                                                                       PCT/US2015/057633
       extracted from a volumetric reference image. For example, a segmented portion
       of the target locus 616 from the volumetric reference image, or a region
       encapsulating the target locus and surrounding tissues, can be spatially registered
       with a corresponding imaging slice 714A, 714B, or 714C to determine if the
  5    target locus has shifted. However, comparing a feature extracted from a single
       two-dimensional imaging slice with a corresponding feature from the volumetric
       reference image can present challenges. For example, FIG. 8A illustrates
       generally a series of imaging acquisition planes 812A, 812B, and 812C, such as
       can be obtained as a target locus 816 moves from one imaging acquisition
 10    instance to another. At time ti-2, a line 806A where the imaging acquisition plane
       intersects the target locus 816 is roughly centered, and at time ti_1, the line 806B
       is shifted, and at time ti, the line 806C is shifted further. Imaging slices obtained
       at times ti, ti_1, ti-2, ... can be labeled as Si, Si-1, Si-2, ... generally.
                If the motion of the target locus is out-of-plane, the centroid or other
 15    feature location may not appear to shift significantly from image-to-image, even
       though the target locus has moved significantly, or the target locus may appear
       to deform making interpretation of motion difficult. However, such out-of-plane
       motion can be properly tracked such as by one or more of varying an orientation
       of successively-acquired imaging slices (e.g., as shown in FIG. 8C and
 20    elsewhere), or varying or compensating for a non-planar shape of the imaging
       acquisition region so that the imaging slices are not represented as perfectly
       planar in a three-dimensional sense (e.g., as shown in FIG. 8B). For example,
       FIG. 8B illustrates generally a series of imaging slices 813A, 813B, and 813C,
       such as can include a curved shape. Generally, even when referring to image
 25    acquisition "planes," the techniques described herein can be used with other slice
       geometries such as the curved slices of FIG. 8B. As an illustrative example, MR
       imaging information may be available as planar slices, and a transformation can
       be applied to the planar slices to obtain surfaces that curve in a three
       dimensional sense, such as to help capture or correct for distortion across the
 30    imaging field such as to compensate for inhomogeneity in an established
                                                      22

WO 2016/069633                                                                            PCT/US2015/057633
       magnetic field. As another illustrative example, FIG. 8C illustrates generally a
       series of imaging acquisition planes 815A, 815B, and 815C such as can include
       different orientations that need not each be orthogonal.
                As mentioned above, if imaging slices are acquired sequentially in time,
  5    the target locus is likely to shift between successive image acquisitions. FIG. 9A
       illustrates generally a series of two imaging slices, such as including a target
       locus that is displaced between first and second imaging slices. The example of
       two sequentially-acquired imaging slices is illustrative. The techniques
       described herein are also generally applicable to sequences of more than two
 10    imaging slices (or even a single imaging slice analyzed with respect to a portion
       or an entirety of the reference volumetric imaging information).
                An imaging slice 914A (e.g., Si) can include a portion 918A of the target
       locus, and a second imaging slice 914B (Si-1, such as acquired earlier in time)
       can include a second portion 918B. The second portion 918B appears displaced
 15    with respect to the first portion 918A by a displacement 920. Because the
       displacement 920 is generally an unknown value or vector, various techniques
       can be used such as to spatially register the first and second portions 918A and
       918B. As shown in FIG. 9B, a spatially-registered slice 914C can include an
       adjusted location of a portion 918C of the target locus. Notationally, a set or
 20    series of acquired imaging slices can be labeled Si, Si-1, Si-2,          ... , Si-n, with Si
       corresponding to the most recently-acquired slice for processing and Si-n
       corresponding to the earliest-acquired slice for processing. A series of spatially
       registered imaging slices can be labeled Si,        S'i-1, S'i-2,... S'i-n.
                FIG. 10 illustrates generally a technique that can include spatially
 25    registering segmented portions of a target locus from two (or more) imaging
       slices Si, Si-1, Si-2, ... , Si-n. In one approach, a metric can be defined that
       quantifies how well the two portions of a target locus 1018A and 1018B are
       aligned (or more generally, how well two imaging slices or imaging volumes are
       aligned), such as the similarity between the pixels along the intersection line
 30    1022 joining the first portion 1018A and the shifted second portion 1018B.
                                                      23

WO 2016/069633                                                               PCT/US2015/057633
       Examples of such metrics include one-dimensional normalized cross-correlation
       or mutual information. An automated optimization technique can be executed to
       find translations of the second portion 1018B that provide the optimal value of
       the metric. Masks can be used to limit the calculation to the most relevant pixels
  5    only, such as pixels close to the target of interest. This first approach generally
       relies on the planes having a common intersection line.
               Another approach can include creating three-dimensional (3D) voxel
       images, such as having a first image corresponding to a first slice orientation
       including populated voxels corresponding to a portion of the target locus within
 10    the slice and zero-valued voxels outside the slice, and a second image of a
       second slice orientation including its own populated voxels corresponding to the
       portion of the target locus in the second image. As an illustrative example, MR
       imaging slices generally have a finite thickness, such as corresponding to about
       5 millimeters. A finite slice thickness can be taken into account by assigning
 15    voxels with slice information within the actual slice thickness using two
       dimensional (2D) pixel information extracted from an MR imaging slice. A 3D
       registration technique can be used find the optimal translation between the two
       3D images and masks can be used to exclude voxels that do not contain slice
       information. The 3D registration approach also generally relies on having a
 20    common intersection line. An illustrative example of three-dimensionally
       registered imaging slices is shown illustratively in FIG. 11 A.
               In yet another approach, a prediction technique can be applied to a prior
       imaging slice to find the most likely position of a portion of the target locus for
       the prior imaging slice orientation but having the same time stamp as the current
 25    or a more-recently-acquired imaging slice. Various techniques can be used for
       such prediction, such as Kernel Density Estimation, a neural network, or a
       template matching technique. Prediction can be particularly effective if a motion
       of the target locus is highly periodic in nature, such as associated with
       respiratory motion. Although using a prediction is an approximation only, it can
 30    also be used in combination with the image-based methods described above and
                                                 24

WO 2016/069633                                                              PCT/US2015/057633
       elsewhere herein. A prediction-based approach does not rely on image
       acquisition planes having a common intersection line, and so prediction
       techniques can be used when parallel slices are acquired.
                In yet another approach, when fast perpendicular MR-imaging slices are
  5    acquired, dark lines can appear in the current image in the location where the
       previous image was excited and not yet fully relaxed to equilibrium. Because the
       excited magnetic dipoles from the previous slice follow the moving anatomy, a
       visible previously-excited region (e.g., an excitation line) can be used as an
       anchor to align previous slices with later-acquired imaging information. This
 10    can be taken into account implicitly with the other techniques mentioned above,
       because such darkened regions as pixel or voxel features can affect registration,
       or explicitly, such as by identifying or explicitly determining the location of such
       darkened regions in acquired imaging slices. For example, a peak-detection
       technique can be used to find points along the center of the darkened regions,
 15    and a line (straight or curved) can be found that provides a best fit to these
       points.Various examples described in this document refer to registration between
       images, such as including registration of a segmented portion of a first image
       with a segmented portion or other identified features of a second image (or a
       series of images). Generally, a registration between two images can include a
 20    moving and a fixed image. The goal can be to determine a position or
       transformation of the moving image such that it best fits the fixed image.
       "Move" can mean, for example, to shift the moving image spatially in one or
       more dimensions (translations only), shift and rotate the moving image, or even
       deform the moving image. The degrees of freedom available to move the
 25    moving image can be referred to as "optimization parameters," which, as an
       illustrative example, can include two degrees of freedom in the case of shift only
       with two 2D images, or 6 degrees of freedom for shifts plus rotations for 3D
       images. Even though we may be generally referring to 3D image registration,
                                                 25

WO 2016/069633                                                              PCT/US2015/057633
       "optimization parameters" can still be generally referred to as "shift values"
       without loss of generality.
                For a given set of optimization parameters, a metric can define a
       "goodness" of a determined overlap between the moving and fixed images.
  5    Various examples can include determining a normalized cross-correlation or
       mutual information (such as using voxel or pixel values as input values), and
       such techniques can provide an indication of an optimal value of the metric
       when the images match perfectly. The nature of the underlying imaging
       technique can be helpful in establishing which metric to use. For example, a
 10    mutual information technique can be used for images obtained using different
       modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and CT imaging.
                An optimization technique can be used to find the shift values that
       optimize the metric between the moving and fixed images, such as to identify
       shift values that give the best match between the two images. Different
 15    optimizers that can be used can include gradient descent, simulating annealing,
       trust-region gradient descent, or one or more other techniques. In some cases,
       there may be deformations between the images, but it is not always necessary to
       optimize deformation vector fields and take these into account, because
       optimization of deformation information can result in one or more of undesired
 20    latency or can erode stability of the optimization technique. Calculation of the
       metric can be limited to a specified region of interest, such as referred to as a
       "mask." For example, assuming there is negligible deformation in the region of
       interest, one or more of translations or rotations, without deformation, can be
       used to determine shift values that are locally optimal in the specified region of
 25    interest.
                Generally, if one or more 2D imaging slices are available, a motion of a
       radiation therapy target can be determined between a current 2D slice (such as
       an MR imaging slice) and an initial 3D volume (e.g., a reference volumetric
       image). As an illustrative example, the 3D volume can also correspond to a
 30    particular phase of respiration to reduce respiration blurring, which can be
                                                 26

WO 2016/069633                                                                PCT/US2015/057633
       accomplished either with gated or triggered imaging (e.g., triggered imaging), or
       by extracting the 3D volumetric image from four-dimensional imaging
       information at a particular phase (e.g., extracting a 3D volumetric snapshot from
       a 4D imaging series, such as 4D imaging information obtained using MR
  5    imaging).
                In one approach, the target itself can be identified in an imaging slice.
       However, while segmentation is mentioned elsewhere herein, the techniques
       described herein are also applicable if segmentation or other feature extraction is
       not performed. As an illustrative example, a best fit of grayscale values can be
 10    determined between one or more later-acquired imaging slices and an earlier
       acquired reference 3D image. A target does not need to actually be in the image,
       but a region of interest can be specified, such as can include a portion of the
       target, or the target plus a margin, or just an arbitrary region of interest without
       the target.
 15             In one approach, a 2D/3D registration can be performed to find a relative
       shift between a current imaging slice and the reference volume. The 3D image
       can represent the 'moving image' and a 2D slice can represent the 'fixed image'
       in relation to the registration technique. Generally, the location of target can be
       identified in the 3D image, and applying the relative shift to the earlier target
 20    location can provide an estimate of an updated location of the target, such as
       within a three-dimensional coordinate frame. Such an estimate can be
       performed without requiring determination of deformation, and may even be
       performed without use of rotational parameters, such as to increase execution
       efficiency of the optimization technique. Such simplifying assumptions can be
 25    applied such as when registering a 3D reference image to one or more 2D
       imaging slices.
                A specified region of interest can be used to define a mask around the
       target plus a margin, for example (though the region of interest need not include
       the target or an entirety of the target). Deformation may be present, but as an
 30    illustrative example, if the margin is small, deformation will also be small (e.g.,
                                                  27

WO 2016/069633                                                              PCT/US2015/057633
       negligible) and a shift of the target itself can be determined using a registration
       technique ignoring deformation. In this manner, a single plane technique (e.g., a
       technique where the imaging slice is the fixed image) can still provide
       information indicative of a shift in three dimensions. Such a technique is robust
  5    when there are enough features in the images to "lock in" the registration in
       three dimensions -- the registration converges to a well-defined optimum -
       though the features need not be extracted or segmented.
                In one approach, a normalized cross-correlation of the gradient of the
       images can be used as a registration metric, since such a technique tends match
 10    images edges and is less sensitive to absolute grayscale values that can differ
       from image to image. A single imaging slice or plane may, in some cases, not
       be sufficiently robust to establish a shift with a clear optimal value (colloquially,
       'lock in'). Accordingly, additional slices can be useful to help lock in all
       directions, for example using a current sagittal and a previously-acquired coronal
 15    slice, or vice-versa, as illustrative examples. As a count of slices used for
       registration increases, whether parallel, orthogonal, or in non-parallel and non
       orthogonal planes, more information is available to perform a registration
       between the reference volumetric image and the later-acquired imaging slices,
       which improves the robustness of the resulting shift parameter determination.
 20             The registration can include sweeping a 3D volume across one or more
       imaging slices, or the slices can be inserted into a 3D volume as mentioned
       elsewhere herein, in which case a 3D-to-3D registration technique can be used
       (such as suppressing or ignoring registration of unfilled voxels).A multiple-slice
       technique works well such as if the slices are acquired in rapid succession, for
 25    example, less than about 50 ms between instants corresponding to acquired
       slices. If a longer duration occurs between imaging slice acquisitions, then the
       older slices may become 'stale.' However, such slices can still be temporally re
       aligned such as using either a) a prediction technique, such as where the target
       motion is periodic in nature; b) aligning the excitation lines provided by the
 30    imaging modality (e.g., excitation lines visible from MR imaging acquisition),
                                                  28

       for example by fitting a line through such excitation lines as mentioned
       elsewhere herein; or c) by spatially-registering the stale imaging slice so that it
       fits with the current slice using a metric that is calculated along a line of
       intersection.
  5             FIG. 11A illustrates generally a composite 1118 representation of a target
       locus, such as after spatial registration of segmented portions of the target locus
       acquired at different times corresponding to spatially-registered imaging slices
       1114A and 1114B. After portions of the target locus from two or more imaging
       slices have been spatially registered, a feature can be extracted such as from a
 10    composite 1118. For example, a centroid location 1108 of the composite 1118
       or other feature can be determined, such as providing an estimate of a centroid
       location of the target locus for use in updating a radiation therapy protocol. In
       another example, a determined spatial displacement between portions of the
       target locus in the first and second imaging slices 1114A and 1114B can be used
 15    to update a radiation therapy protocol.
                FIG. 11 B illustrates generally a technique for determining a difference
       between a later estimated or predicted location of a composite 1118 of the target
       locus according to acquired spatially-registered imaging information as
       compared to an earlier location of the target locus 616 such as represented by
 20    earlier-acquired volumetric imaging information. A displacement of one or
       more features can be used to estimate a present or future target locus location.
       For example, a displacement can be determined between an earlier-determined
       centroid 608 extracted from the reference imaging information and later
       determined centroid 1108.       In another example, shift parameters from an
 25    imaging registration can be used to provide an updated target locus without
       requiring extraction or determination of features such as a centroid. Generally, a
       variety of other techniques can be used such as to extract information indicative
                                                  29

WO 2016/069633                                                                PCT/US2015/057633
       of a motion or displacement of the target locus 616 using spatially-registered
       imaging slices.
                For example, once a set of previous imaging slices are aligned to the
       current slice to form a slice set S., S'  , S'  , ... S'-,, an optimal registration
  5    between the slice set (or a composite 1108 generated from such a slice set) and a
       three-dimensional reference volume can be found (such as a reference volume
       corresponding to the target locus 616 as shown in FIG. 11B). As an illustrative
       example, a sagittal slice acquisition can be preceded by a coronal slice
       acquisition. A spatial translation can be identified that brings the coronal slice to
 10    the same time point as the sagittal slice to spatially register the coronal slice with
       the sagittal slice. Then, both slices can be established within a 3D voxel
       coordinate space. This can be done by inserting the slices as infinitesimally thin
       slices, or as finite slices using the known slice thickness (such as shown in the
       composite 1118 of FIG. 11A and FIG. 11B).
 15             Voxels that are not filled by portions of the target locus from each slice
       can be left unfilled. A 3D-to-3D registration can then be determined between the
       3D reference image (e.g., corresponding to target locus 616) and the 3D "slice
       filled image" (corresponding to the composite 1118). A mask can be used to
       filter out voxels that have not been filled. In another example, a 3D-to-2D
 20    registration can be performed, such as using multiple 2D slices rather than a
       single composite. For example, shift parameters (e.g., displacement of one or
       more features such as a centroid or a set of shift values specifying a translation
       or rotation of region of interest) of the 3D reference image can be evaluated,
       such as optimizing values of a similarity metric that compares the voxels of the
 25    shifted 3D volumetric reference image to each of the slices of the multiple 2D
       imaging slices, using registration and optimization techniques as mentioned
       above. In this manner, a 3D-to-2D registration can be performed, such as to
       identify an optimal set of shift values. A location of the target can be updated
       using information obtained from the shift values. 3D-to-3D, 2D-to-2D, or 3D
 30    to-2D registration techniques need not require image segmentation (e.g., the
                                                  30

       target locus itself need not be segmented), and such registration need not require
       identification of imaging features such as a centroid or edge location. Instead,
       registration can be performed using grayscale or contrast imaging information
       (or other extracted values), such as over a specified region of interest generally
  5    as mentioned elsewhere herein
               FIG. 11C illustrates generally a technique for updating a therapy
       protocol, such as to shift a therapy locus to a new location. An earlier radiation
       therapy target region 1110A can be established, such as corresponding to a target
       locus extracted from a volumetric reference image or established according to
 10    other treatment or dosimetric objectives. Such a therapy target region 1110A
       can be established at least in part using one or more of positioning a radiation
       therapy output, modulating a therapy beam including modulating one or more of
       intensity or beam shape, or moving the patient using an actuator such as a
       moveable therapy couch or platform. One or more features can be extracted
 15    from the therapy target region, such as a centroid 1108A. An estimated or
       predicted displacement of the target locus (e.g., a tumor or other structure to be
       treated) can be determined, such as using other techniques as described herein.
               The therapy target region 1110A can be adjusted to provide an updated
       therapy target region 1110B. For example, if the target locus has been translated
 20    due to patient motion, a similar displacement can be applied to the earlier
       centroid 1110A to provide an updated therapy target region 1110B centroid
       1108B. Similarly, if other features are extracted, the therapy target region
       1110A can be adjusted using other techniques such as rotation or scaling. In
       another example, instead of or in addition to adjusting the therapy target region
 25    1110A, other techniques can be used to control therapy, such as gating therapy
       to inhibit delivery of radiation therapy unless an updated therapy target region
       1110B falls within a specified zone. In yet another example, a surrogate signal,
       such as derived from a sensor output, can be used to gate therapy. For example,
       a sensor output can be correlated with the location of a feature extracted from
 30    imaging slices, such as a centroid location of a target locus within the imaging
                                                 31

       slices after the imaging slices are spatially-registered. Therapy delivery can be
       gated in a synchronous manner, such as triggered in response to the sensor
       output (e.g., such as to deliver therapy at a certain time during a periodic motion
       such as respiration).
  5             The techniques described above can be performed in a serial manner,
       such as including acquiring images and processing such images, then acquiring
       another series of images, and processing the subsequently-acquired set of
       images. In another approach, one or more portions of the techniques described
       herein can be performed in parallel or in an interleaved manner, such as to
 10    provide ongoing generation of displacement or other information for use in
       updating a therapy protocol in an adaptive manner. For example, FIG. 12
       illustrates a technique that can include interleaving processing of imaging
       information corresponding to previously-acquired imaging slices with imaging
       acquisitions, such as to enhance efficiency of other techniques described herein.
 15    An imaging acquisition system can acquire imaging slices, such as slices Si, Si-1,
       Si-2, Si-3,... corresponding to acquisition times ti, ti_1, ti-2 , ti_3 ,... as shown
       illustratively in FIG. 12. At time t, the slice Si can be acquired and one or more
       previously-acquired slices, such slices Si_ and    Si-2  can be spatially registered to
       each other or otherwise processed during acquisition of the imaging slice Si.
 20             As an illustrative example, the imaging slices are shown as two
       dimensional planes that are orthogonal to each other. However, as mentioned in
       relation to other examples herein, the slices need not be planar nor orthogonal.
       Each acquired imaging slice can be processed, including processing of one or
       more slices in parallel with an acquisition of an imaging slice. For example,
 25    such processing can include sampled information from a volumetric reference
       image, such as corresponding to a plane or region of the acquired imaging slice.
       The extent of a target locus (e.g., a tumor or other anatomical structure that can
       be used as a landmark for adaptively directing radiation therapy) can be
                                                  32

WO 2016/069633                                                                PCT/US2015/057633
       extracted from one or more segmented structures in the volumetric reference
       image.
               A margin can be added to that extent of the target locus, such as to define
       a region within which the target locus must be located in subsequently-acquired
  5    imaging slices. The margin can be adjusted based on factors such as an image
       acquisition rate (the lower the acquisition rate, the farther the tumor or other
       target can travel between image acquisitions and the margin can be
       correspondingly enlarged). The tumor or other target can be segmented in an
       acquired imaging slice. Segmented target information extracted from one or
 10    more imaging slices can be spatially-registered with the target locus identified in
       the planning image. Such registration, as described in other examples herein,
       can be used to determine an updated target locus or to otherwise control or adapt
       therapy. For example, the updated target locus can be used to gate the treatment,
       such as pausing the treatment while the updated target locus indicates that the
 15    target locus is partially or entirely outside a specified spatial gating window, or
       the updated target locus can be used to adapt the beam aperture shape to track
       the tumor, as illustrative examples.
               While performing such processing, previously-acquired imaging slices
       can be re-used, such as to make gating or tracking updates at a higher rate, such
 20    as shown illustrative in FIG. 12. Information about the update target locus, such
       as an extracted feature location (e.g., a centroid location) can be used to adjust a
       location or orientation of future acquired imaging slices, such as to re-center or
       otherwise keep a desired portion of the target locus within the imaging field.
               FIG. 13 illustrates generally a technique 1300, such as a method, that can
 25    include receiving volumetric imaging information at 1302, such as a reference
       image, and receiving imaging slices 1304, including determining a difference in
       the location of the target locus at 1308. A portion or an entirety of the technique
       1300 (or other techniques described herein) can be performed such as using a

       system or other elements as shown in FIG. 1A, FIG. 1B, FIG. 1C, FIG. 1D, FIG.
       2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4 or FIG. 5.
               At 1302, volumetric imaging information can be received, such as
       corresponding to a planning or reference image. The volumetric imaging
  5    information can include a target locus, such as comprising a region of voxels to
       be targeted with a radiation therapy. As mentioned elsewhere herein, an imaging
       acquisition latency may preclude obtaining full volumetric imaging of the target
       locus in a real-time manner, such as intra-fractionally. Accordingly, at 1304,
       imaging information can be received such as comprising one or more imaging
 10    slices. For example, two imaging slices can be acquired, such as at different
       time periods different instants after acquisition of the volumetric image received
       at 1302. If the two imaging slices are acquired at different times, a location of a
       portion of the target locus in each of the imaging slices can be different (and
       such imaging slices can be referred to as "temporally misaligned").
 15            At 1306, if the imaging slices are temporally misaligned, information
       (such as indicative of the target locus) from an earlier-acquired one of the at least
       two imaging slices can be spatially registered with at least a portion of a later
       acquired one of the at least two imaging slices. At 1308, a difference can be
       determined between a location of the target locus indicated by the spatially
 20    registered information and an earlier location of the target locus indicated by the
       volumetric image received at 1302. For example, a registration technique can be
       used as mentioned above, such as to determine a shift in a feature such as a
       centroid of the target locus or a shift in the target without requiring segmentation
       or feature extraction. Determined shift values can provide information
 25    indicative of an updated location of the target or other region of interest.
               Optionally, at 1310, a therapy locus (e.g., an area or volume targeted by a
       radiation therapy beam) can be updated using information about the updated
       location of the target determined at 1308. In addition, or instead, optionally, at
       1312, the therapy beam operation can be gated, such as to enable therapy
 30    delivery when the therapy is properly aligned with the updated or estimated
                                                  34
