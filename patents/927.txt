CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]        This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/582,778, filed January 3, 2012, PCT/US2013/020179 filed 3 January 2013
and is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2013206887. The entire contents

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]        The present technology relates to vitamin D phototherapy, and more particularly to
phototherapeutic apparatuses for focused UVB radiation and vitamin D synthesis and associated
systems and methods.
BACKGROUND
[0003]        Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble secosteriods that the human body can
synthesize through adequate exposure to sunlight. More specifically, vitamin D 3 is made in the
skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol reacts with ultraviolet B ("UVB") light. Vitamin D can also be
absorbed from the various dietary sources, such as fatty fish (e.g., salmon and tuna), vitamin D
fortified foods (e.g., dairy and juice products), and vitamin D supplements. Once absorbed, the
vitamin D travels through the bloodstream to the liver where it is converted into the prohormone
calcidiol.   The calcidiol is, in turn, converted into calcitriol (the hormonally active form of
vitamin D) by the kidneys or monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized
by the monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine to defend the body against
microbial invaders.     Kidney-synthesized calcitriol circulates through the body to regulate the
concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, and thereby promotes adequate
mineralization, growth, and reconstruction of the bones.        Therefore, an inadequate level of
vitamin D, (typically characterized by a calcidiol concentration in the blood of less than 20-40
ng/m 2) can cause various bone softening diseases, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in
                                                  -1-

adults. Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to numerous other diseases and disorders,
such as depression, heart disease, gout, autoimmune disorders, and a variety of different cancers.
[0004]        Recently, vitamin D deficiency has become a prominent condition due, at least in
part, to increasingly metropolitan populations and the resultant indoor lifestyles that inhibit
adequate daily exposure to sunlight for vitamin D production. The growing emphasis on skin
cancer awareness and sunscreen protection, which blocks UVB rays, may have also increased the
spread of vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, various environmental factors, such as geographic
latitude, seasons, and smog, further impede sufficient vitamin D production.
[0005]        Physicians have recommended vitamin D supplements as a preventative measure to
increase vitamin D levels. The American Institute of Medicine, for example, recommends a
daily dietary vitamin D intake of 600 international units (IU) for those 1-70 years of age, and 800
IU for those 71 years of age and older. Other institutions have recommended both higher and
lower daily vitamin D doses. The limitations on daily dosages also reflect an effort to prevent
ingesting too much vitamin D, which can eventually become toxic. In contrast, the human
physiology has adapted to significantly higher daily doses of vitamin D from sunlight (e.g.,
4,000-20,000 IU/day or more). UVB radiation has been identified as a more desirable source of
vitamin D because of the ease at which vitamin D is produced from exposure to sunlight and the
body's natural ability to inhibit excessive vitamin D intake through the skin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0019]     The present technology is directed to apparatuses, systems, and methods for providing
focused UVB radiation for vitamin D synthesis. Specific details of several embodiments of the
technology are described below with reference to Figures 1A-8.            Although many of the
embodiments are described below with respect to phototherapeutic systems, devices, and
                                                 -3-

methods    for promoting vitamin         D production  in the   skin, other applications      (e.g.,
phototherapeutic treatment of skin diseases) and other embodiments in addition to those
described herein are within the scope of the technology.             Additionally, several other
embodiments of the technology can have different configurations, components, or procedures
than those described herein. A person of ordinary skill in the art, therefore, will accordingly
understand that the technology can have other embodiments with additional elements, or the
technology can have other embodiments without several of the features shown and described
below with reference to Figures 1A-8.
[0020]     Figures 1A and 1B are isometric views of a phototherapeutic apparatus 100
("apparatus 100") for focused UVB radiation in an open position and a closed position,
respectively, in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology, and Figure 1C is a
top view of the apparatus 100 of Figures 1A and 1B. Referring to Figures lA-IC together, the
apparatus 100 can include a housing 102 having one or more sidewalls 104 and a door 108 that
define a chamber or interior space 106 configured to accommodate a user (e.g., a human patient).
The housing 102 can carry a plurality of focused UVB radiation assemblies 110 that direct
focused UVB radiation generally toward the interior space 106 or an irradiation zone in which
the user can be exposed to focused UVB radiation. The focused UVB radiation assemblies 110
can generate UVB radiation within a predetermined spectrum to promote vitamin D production
in human skin. For example, the predetermined spectrum can have a bandwidth of about 8 nm
focused at about 297 nm (i.e., about 293-301 nm), which is generally considered the peak
wavelength for vitamin D synthesis.       In other embodiments, the predetermined spectrum of
radiation can have a wider or narrower bandwidth (e.g., about 6-10 nm) and can be focused
around other wavelengths (e.g., 296 nm, 300 nm, 302 nm, etc.) suitable for vitamin D
production. The concentrated UVB radiation provided by the apparatus 100 can deliver a large
dose of vitamin D (e.g., a weekly dose, a monthly dose, etc.) to the user within a relatively short
phototherapy session (e.g., less than 10 minutes, less than 5 minutes, less than 2 minutes, less
than 1 minute, etc.) in comparison to the length of sun exposure necessary to produce the same
amount of vitamin D. In other embodiments, the focused UVB radiation assemblies 110 can be
focused around other UVB wavelengths that provide therapeutic effects for skin diseases (e.g.,
psoriasis) or other disorders (e.g., eczema).
[0021]     The housing 102 can be sized to allow users (e.g., adult humans) to stand completely
within the interior space 106 during a phototherapy session. For example, the user can pivot,
                                                 -4-

slide, and/or otherwise open the door 108 (e.g., as shown in Figure 1A) to enter the interior space
106 and close the door 108 (e.g., as shown in Figure 1B) to at least partially enclose the user
within the housing 102.        In various embodiments, the housing 102 can have a height
of approximately 90-100 inches (228.6-254 cm) and an outer diameter of approximately 40-50
inches (101.6-127 cm), such as the Maxter V19 ER vertical tanning beds available from ISO
Italia USA of Cleveland, Ohio. In other embodiments, the housing 102 can have other suitable
dimensions and/or orientations to accommodate users within the interior space 106.              For
example, the housing 102 can be configured horizontally to allow the user to lie down during the
phototherapy session. The full-body enclosure provided by the housing 102 can expose a large
portion of the user's skin to the focused UVB radiation generated in the interior space 106, and
therefore promote a substantial amount of vitamin D production via the user's skin during the
phototherapy session. In other embodiments, the housing 102 can be smaller and/or configured
to accommodate only a portion of the body, such as the face or upper body.
[0022]     As shown in Figures 1A and IC, a plurality of the focused UVB radiation assemblies
110 can be positioned on or in the sidewall 104 and/or the door 108 of the housing 102 behind
protective covers or panels 111, and directed toward the interior space 106 such that the focused
UVB radiation assemblies 110 at least partially surround the interior space 106. In the illustrated
embodiment, the focused UVB radiation assemblies 110 are arranged in four columns around the
perimeter of the interior space 106.       In other embodiments, the focused UVB radiation
assemblies 110 can be arranged in more or fewer columns, or otherwise positioned at least
partially around the interior space 106.
[0023]     As shown in Figure IC, the apparatus 100 can further include one or more cooling
fans 118 or other cooling features directed generally toward the focused UVB radiation
assemblies 110 and/or the interior space 106 of the housing 102 to at least reduce the operating
temperature of the UVB radiation assemblies 110. The fans 118 can also be configured to cool
the UVB radiation assemblies 110 before and/or after operation. In selected embodiments, the
apparatus 100 can be configured to activate the fans 118 after the UVB radiation assemblies 110
have been turned on to allow the assemblies 110 to quickly ramp up to an operating temperature
(e.g., a temperature that allows the UVB radiation assemblies 110 to generate UVB radiation)
without interference from the fans 118. The duration of the delay between activation of the
assemblies 110 and fan initiation can be, for example, less than a minute (e.g., 10-15 seconds, 3
5 seconds, etc.). The fan delay can decrease the overall phototherapy time (e.g., 30 seconds, 2
                                                 -5-

minutes, 5 minutes, etc.) by decreasing the time it takes for the UVB radiation assemblies 110 to
begin producing focused UVB radiation. In other embodiments, the fans 118 can be set at a
relatively low intensity and/or speed (e.g., as compared to typical tanning bed fans) to decrease
the interference with the ramp up time of the UVB radiation assemblies 110.             In further
embodiments, the apparatus 100 can be configured to prevent the user from entering the interior
space 106 until after the UVB radiation assemblies 110 are at or near their operating temperature
such that the ramp up time does not increase the overall phototherapy time.
[0024]      Figure ID is an enlarged side view of an individual focused UVB assembly 110
configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.         The focused UVB
assembly 110 can include a UV radiation source 112 and a filter 116 on or over the UV radiation
source 112 that at least substantially blocks UV radiation outside of a predetermined spectrum
that facilitates vitamin D synthesis. In certain embodiments, for example, the filter 116 can
substantially block UV radiation outside of a predetermined 10 nm spectrum ranging from
approximately 292 nm to approximately 302 nm (i.e., centered at about 297 nm). In other
embodiments, the filter 116 can be configured to block UV radiation outside of a predetermined
spectrum having a wider or narrower bandwidth (e.g., a 5 nm spread, a 6 nm spread, an 8 nm
spread, a 20 nm spread) and/or centered around a higher or lower wavelength (e.g., 296 nm, 300
nm, 302 nm, etc.).
[0025]      In selected embodiments, the UV radiation source 112 includes one or more high
intensity discharge ("HID") lamps, such as a metal-halide lamp that generates light by producing
an electric arc through a gaseous mixture between electrodes 113 in an arc tube 115.           As
described in further detail below, in certain embodiments, the metal-halide radiation source 112
can be doped with chemicals to increase the UVB content of the energy emitted by the radiation
source 112. In other embodiments, the UV radiation source 112 can include other types of HID
lamps, lamps having higher or lower powered bulbs (e.g., 160 W, 200 W, 500 W, 650 W, 700
W, 800 W, etc.), and/or other suitable UV radiation sources. For example, the radiation source
112 can include a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs) that can emit light at one or more
predetermined wavelengths (e.g., LEDs available from Sensor Electronic Technology, Inc. of
Columbus, South Carolina), excimer lamps that can emit light within a narrow spectral range
(e.g., excimer lamps available from Ushio of Cypress, California), and/or pulsed xenon lamps
(e.g., as described in further detail below with respect to Figure 7).
                                                  -6-

[0026]      In various embodiments, each of the UV radiation sources 112 may have the same
intensity to provide substantially uniform UVB exposure to the user in the interior chamber 106.
In other embodiments, the UV radiation sources 112 can be arranged according to varying
degrees of power. For example, one or more UV radiation sources 112 with higher powered
HID lamps (e.g., 650-800 W) can be positioned at an upper portion of the apparatus 100
(Figures 1A and IC) proximate the facial region and one or more lower powered HID lamps
(e.g., 500-600 W lamps) can be positioned at the lower portion of the apparatus 100. In other
embodiments, the UV radiation sources 112 can be arranged in other suitable configurations to
transmit UV radiation toward the interior space 106 of the apparatus 100.
[0027]         In the embodiment illustrated in Figure ID, the filter 116 is a coated cylindrical
tube or sleeve 119 that extends over the length (e.g., 4 inches) of the UV radiation source 112
and is offset from the UV radiation source 112 by a plurality of stand-offs 114 at each end
portion of the filter 116. The stand-offs 114, for example, can create a 1 inch (25.4 mm) space
between the UV radiation source 112 and the filter 116. The sleeve 119 may also provide an
insulative enclosure over the UV radiation source 112 that allows the radiation source 112 to
ramp up quickly to its operating temperature. In other embodiments, the stand-offs 114 can be
longer or shorter, and/or the filter 116 can be separated from the UV radiation source 112 using
other suitable means. In further embodiments, the filter 116 can have other suitable shapes that
cover at least a portion of the UV radiation source 112.
[0028]      The sleeve 119 can be made from a substrate (e.g., quartz glass, Plexiglas, etc.) coated
with UV or other optical filtering materials, such as hafnium dioxide, zinc oxide, cesium,
titanium dioxide, and/or various other optical filtering materials. One or more coatings can be
applied to the substrate to filter out UV radiation below a lower threshold of the predetermined
spectrum (e.g., wavelengths below 100 nm, 285 nm, 287 nm, 294 nm, etc.), and additional
coatings can be applied to the substrate to filter out UV radiation above an upper threshold of the
predetermined spectrum (e.g., wavelengths above 300 nm, 302 nm, 310 nm, etc.). For example,
the filter 116 can include a titanium dioxide coating to block wavelengths less than 185 nm and
prevent ozone from forming, and can include additional coatings to block other wavelengths
outside the predetermined spectrum. In other embodiments, the substrate can include a single
coating configured to at least substantially block UV radiation outside of the predetermined
spectrum. In further embodiments, the substrate itself can serve as an absorption filter to block
at least some energy with wavelengths below a predetermined spectrum, and an interference
                                                  -7-

coating can be applied to the substrate to block energy with wavelengths higher than the
predetermined spectrum.
[0029]      The coating(s) can be applied to the sleeve 119 using chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), other deposition processes, and/or other suitable filter
coating methods. In other embodiments, one or more coatings can be applied directly onto the
UV radiation source 112 to block at least some of the UV radiation as it exits the source 112. In
further embodiments, the filter coating(s) can be applied to other portions of the apparatus 100
between the UV radiation source 112 and the interior chamber 106 of the housing 102. For
example, filter coating(s) can be applied to the protective covers 111 (Figures 1A and IC) in
front of the UVB radiation assemblies 110. In still further embodiments, the sleeve 119 and/or a
portion of the UV radiation source 112 can be doped with filtering materials rather than coated.
[0030]      In selected embodiments, the UV radiation source 112 can include a filament that
generates radiation at least partially concentrated within the predetermined spectrum.         For
example, mercury-based lamps can have a relatively strong concentration of UVB radiation
around 297 nm, and may therefore be used in conjunction with or in lieu of the filter 116 to
transmit focused UVB radiation suitable for vitamin D synthesis. In other embodiments, the UV
radiation source 112 can include other suitable filaments and/or features that reduce UV
radiation outside of the predetermined spectrum.
[0031]      Figures 2A and 2B are exemplary graphical representations of the relative spectral
powers of the UV radiation source 112 before and after focusing the UVB radiation with the
filter 116. As shown in Figure 2A, the UV radiation source 112 may generate UV light in a
broad spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., between about 260-400 nm (i.e., visible light)). However,
as shown in Figure 2B, applying the filter 116 (e.g., the coated or doped sleeve 119, a coating on
the UV radiation source 112, etc.) to the UV radiation source 112 can at least substantially block
UV radiation less than approximately 290 nm and greater than approximately 310 nm. The filter
116 can, therefore, concentrate the UV radiation emitted by the UV radiation source 112 around
the wavelengths associated with vitamin D production (e.g., 297 nm, 300 nm, 302 nm, etc.), and
thereby provide sufficient UVB radiation to initiate high levels of vitamin D production (e.g.,
about 40,000 IU, about 70,000 IU, about 100,000 IU, etc.) within a relatively short period of
time (e.g., less than 1 minute, less than 5 minutes, etc.).
                                                  -8-

[0032]     During a phototherapy session, the apparatus 100 can expose the user to focused UVB
radiation within a predetermined radiation spectrum to deliver a dose of vitamin D within a
relatively short exposure time. In one embodiment, for example, the apparatus 100 can provide
a dose of vitamin D in less than two minutes. The dose of vitamin D can be equivalent to the
user's required weekly dose of vitamin D. For example, if the user requires a daily vitamin D
dose of approximately 10,000 TU from sunlight, the apparatus 100 can deliver approximately
70,000 TU during the phototherapy session. In other embodiments, the apparatus 100 can be
configured to provide larger or smaller daily vitamin D doses (e.g., 6,000 IU/day, 20,000 I/day,
etc.), and/or the vitamin D dose can correspond to vitamin D requirements for longer or shorter
periods of time (e.g., a two day dose, a two week dose, a monthly dose, etc.).
[0033]      The amount of vitamin D in the vitamin D dose can vary depending on user-specific
characteristics, such as skin type (e.g., as determined by the Fitzpatrick scale or modifications
thereof), age, weight, average sun exposure, and/or other parameters that may affect the vitamin
D synthesis and needs. For example, users with lighter skin tones typically require a shorter
UVB exposure times and/or lesser UVB intensities to receive a sufficient vitamin D dose than
users with darker skin tones.     Older users produce less vitamin D from the same amount of
exposure to UVB as younger users, and therefore typically require longer exposure times and/or
greater UVB intensity than younger users. The apparatus 100 can therefore be configured to
provide varying levels of vitamin D by adjusting the duration of the phototherapy session and/or
intensity of the focused UVB radiation. In other embodiments, the apparatus 100 does not adjust
for user-specific characteristics, and performs a standardized phototherapy session on all users.
Without being bound by theory, it is thought that the human body will inherently prevent toxic
levels of vitamin D from being produced in the skin when the user is exposed to higher than
necessary UVB radiation. Therefore, the apparatus 100 is at least less likely to produce toxic
levels of vitamin D than vitamin D taken in the form of dietary supplements, which bypass the
body's built-in protection.
[0034]      The apparatus 100 can be adjusted for variations in the vitamin D dose using a local
controller 121 (Figures 1A and 1B; shown schematically) and/or remote server coupled thereto
via a communications link (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, etc.) based on various operational
parameters. For example, the controller 121 can increase the vitamin D dose provided during a
phototherapy session by increasing the length of the phototherapy session (i.e., the exposure
time) because the user receives more UVB radiation during longer exposure times. The vitamin
                                                 -9-

D dose can also be increased by increasing the concentration of filtered UVB rays associated
with vitamin D synthesis (e.g., via the filter 116). In selected embodiments, the apparatus 100
can emit concentrated levels of UVB radiation that provide users with weekly doses of vitamin
D within short exposure times, such as less than 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30
seconds, etc.
[0035]     In various embodiments, the apparatus 100 can be configured to limit the vitamin D
dose based on a minimum erythemal dose ("MED"), which is the threshold dose of UVB
radiation that produces erythema (i.e., visible reddening of the skin 24 hours after exposure).
The MED depends on the user's skin type, but the measurement has been standardized (using
unprotected, untanned skin type 2 on the Fitzpatrick skin type scale) to compare and control
UVB exposure in tanning beds.       For example, certain regulations prohibit tanning beds from
exceeding 4 standardized MEDs per exposure.            As such, the apparatus 100 can also be
configured to limit phototherapy sessions to 4 standardized MEDs. In other embodiments, the
apparatus 100 can limit phototherapy sessions to less than 4 standardized MEDs, while still
providing users with relatively high vitamin D doses because the narrow bandwidth of radiation
generated by the UVB radiation assemblies 110 limit the user's UVB exposure to the focused
spectrum of UVB radiation associated with vitamin D synthesis.          In one embodiment, for
example, the apparatus 100 can limit phototherapy sessions to approximately 1 standardized
MED. In other embodiments, the apparatus 100 can adjust the phototherapy session based on
the MED associated with the user's skin type (e.g., 75% of the user's MED, 50% of the user's
MED, etc.).    Accordingly, the apparatus 100 can at least reduce the likelihood of skin redness
resulting from UVB exposure, while still providing sufficient levels of focused UVB radiation to
induce vitamin D production during the phototherapy session. Therefore, the apparatus 100 can
be configured to inhibit the negative effects (e.g., sunburn and skin cancer) typically associated
with tanning beds and/or excessive sun exposure.
[0036]     As further shown in Figures 1A and 1B, the apparatus 100 can also include a user
interface 120 that allows the apparatus 100 to operationally interface with individuals receiving
phototherapy (e.g., the users) and/or individuals administering the phototherapy (e.g., physicians
or trained technicians) via visual and/or audible signals (e.g., textual instructions, audible
commands, animations, etc.). For example, the user interface 120 can include a touch screen,
display screen, keyboard, mouse, card swipe, PIN pad, and/or other suitable devices that can
receive information and/or otherwise communicate with users. In the illustrated embodiment,
                                                -10-

the user interface 120 is positioned on the exterior of the housing 102.          However, in other
embodiments, the user interface 120 can be positioned elsewhere on the apparatus 100 (e.g.,
within the interior space 106), or can be remotely coupled to the apparatus 100 (e.g., via the
Internet, a secured intranet, and/or other suitable connection).
[0037]      The user interface 120 can provide instructions to the user related to the apparatus 100
and/or query the user regarding various user-specific characteristics that may affect the
parameters of the UVB exposure provided by the apparatus 100. For example, the user interface
120 can instruct or prompt the user to answer questions related to his or her skin type (e.g., using
a Fitzpatrick skin test and/or modifications thereof), and the apparatus 100 can use the answers
to identify the user's skin type (e.g., via a controller or a remote computer communicatively
coupled to the apparatus 100).        The user interface 120 can also be configured to receive
information related to the user's age, weight, recent sun exposure, diet, and/or other suitable
factors that may affect the user's vitamin D needs. This user-specific information can be used to
derive parameters for a phototherapy session, such as exposure time.
[0038]      In selected embodiments, the user interface 120 can also be configured to receive
feedback related to previous phototherapy sessions. For example, the user can indicate whether
he or she experienced any redness caused by a previous phototherapy session (i.e., the
phototherapy session exceeded the user's MED), and the apparatus 100 can adjust the parameters
of subsequent phototherapy sessions to reduce or prevent future redness.
[0039]      The user interface 120 can also be configured to create user accounts that associate
users with phototherapy sessions performed by the apparatus 100 and/or other phototherapeutic
apparatuses communicatively linked to the apparatus 100 in the same network. Figures 3A-3C,
for example, illustrate display pages 350a-c, respectively, on the user interface 120 that can be
used to register and log into a user account. In other embodiments, the display pages 350a-c can
be displayed on other portions of the apparatus 100 (e.g., an additional display) and/or remote
devices communicatively coupled thereto, such as a home computer or mobile phone
communicatively coupled to the apparatus 100 via the Internet or other suitable communications
link.
[0040]      Referring first to Figure 3A, the display page 350a can include various buttons or
icons that allow the user to enter user identification information to register or create a user
account. In the illustrated embodiment, the display page 350a includes a box 352 that requests
                                                  -11-

the user to enter his or her phone number using a key pad 354 displayed on the display page
350a. The display page 350a also includes a "delete" button 356 to edit the numbers entered in
the box 352 and buttons to navigate between display pages, such as a "back" button 358 to return
to the previous page, a "main" button 360 to return to a home page, and/or other suitable buttons.
In other embodiments, the display page 350a can be configured to receive other forms of user
identification information to create the user account, including an email address and credit card
information (e.g., entered via a card swipe).
[0041]      Once the user has entered his or her identification information, the user can select a
"next" button 362 to navigate to display page 350b illustrated in Figure 3B. The display page
350b allows a user to log into his or her user account. A new user can scan his or her fingerprint
via a fingerprint scan box 364 on the display page 364 during the initial registration phase, and
the apparatus 100 can store this information locally or remotely on a database to allow the user
to log into his or her user account during subsequent phototherapy sessions via fingerprint
identification.   In other embodiments, the fingerprint scan can be performed by a device
positioned elsewhere on the apparatus 100. If the user does not wish to log in using his or her
fingerprint, the user can select a "manual login" button 366 to manually access the user's account
by typing in a user name, password, and/or other information that associates the user with his or
her user account. In further embodiments, the user interface 120 can include facial recognition
software that allows the apparatus 100 to recognize the user by scanning his or her face. This
facial recognition scan may also be configured to allow the user interface 120 to determine the
user's skin type and adjust the parameters of the phototherapy session accordingly.           In still
further embodiments, the user interface 120 and/or other portion of the apparatus 100 can
include other suitable forms of biometric recognition to identify users.
[0042]      Once the user has logged into his or her account, the user interface 120 can navigate to
display page 350c shown in Figure 3C that can serve as the user's home page. The display page
350c can include a plurality of selection buttons 368 that navigate the user interface 120 to
various other display pages. For example, selecting a "timer control" button 368 can navigate
the user interface 120 to a display page that allows the user to select or enter the duration of his
or her phototherapy session. The user can select the "your account" button 368 to view and/or
edit information related to his or her user account (e.g., the user's address, medical history, credit
card associated with the user account, etc.), and the user can select the "settings" button 368 to
navigate the user interface 120 to a display page where the user can view and/or edit settings
                                                 -12-

associated with the apparatus 100, user preferences, and/or other user-specific settings (e.g., skin
type, age, etc.). In various embodiments, the user can select the "settings" button 368 and/or
other buttons on the display page 350c to enter feedback related to previous phototherapy
sessions, and the apparatus 100 can modify subsequent phototherapy sessions accordingly. The
"reports" button 368 can be selected to illustrate data related to the user's previous phototherapy
sessions. For example, previous doses of vitamin D can be displayed for the user in the form of
charts and/or graphs. The "reports" button 368 can also be configured to display other types of
summaries related to the user and previous phototherapy sessions. In various embodiments, the
user can select the "shop" button 368 to purchase a package of phototherapy sessions (e.g., on a
per minute and/or per session basis) and/or related products.        The "info" button 368 can be
selected to show information related to the apparatus             100 in general (e.g.,    technical
specifications), vitamin D-related information (e.g., daily dose recommendations, effects of
vitamin D deficiency, articles related to vitamin D, etc.), and/or other suitable information. The
"info" button can also be used to access online resources (e.g., medical journals) when the
apparatus 100 is connected to the Internet and/or a secured intranet. When the apparatus 100 is
connected to the Internet or an intranet, the selection buttons 368 can be used to access online
resources (e.g., medical journals).
[0043]     As further shown in Figure 3C, the display page 350c can also include an activation
button 370 (labeled "use Dshot") that allows the user to begin a phototherapy session. In various
embodiments, the activation button 370 may navigate the display page 350c to a display that
requests the user to add information that may affect the parameters of the phototherapy session.
In another embodiment, the activation button 370 may begin a countdown to the beginning of
the phototherapy session. This embodiment can accommodate for the ramp up time of the UVB
radiation source 112 and/or other features of the apparatus 100.         Additionally, as shown in
Figure 3C, the display page 350c can include an "exit" button 372 at any time to log out of his or
her user account.
[0044]      Figure 4 is a block diagram illustrating a method 400 of generating focused UVB
radiation for vitamin D synthesis in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.
In various embodiments, the method 400 can be performed by a phototherapeutic apparatus
including features generally similar to the features of the apparatus 100 described above with
reference to Figures 1A-3C.      The method 400 can optionally include receiving user-specific
information before a vitamin D phototherapy session (block 410). The user-specific information
                                                -13-

may include skin type (e.g., as characterized by the Fitzpatrick scale), age, weight, current
vitamin D level, feedback related to previous vitamin D phototherapy sessions, and/or other
information that may affect the user's vitamin D dose and/or operating parameters of the
phototherapeutic apparatus.    In selected embodiments, the person undergoing the vitamin D
phototherapy (i.e., the user) can enter his or her user-specific information via a user interface
and/or other suitable device communicatively coupled to the phototherapeutic apparatus (e.g.,
via a website and/or a smart phone application).          In other embodiments, the individual
administering the phototherapy session (e.g., a physician, a nurse, etc.) can input the user
specific information via a user interface, a remote computer communicatively coupled to the
phototherapeutic apparatus, and/or other suitable input devices. This embodiment allows the
phototherapy to be controlled by a professional and avoids improper use by an untrained user.
[0045]     The method 400 can continue by determining performance parameters of the
phototherapy session via a local controller and/or a remote server coupled thereto (block 420).
For example, an algorithm can use the user-specific information to determine the appropriate
vitamin D dose provided by the apparatus, the duration of the phototherapy session, and/or the
intensity of focused UVB exposure for the phototherapy session. In other embodiments, the user
can select operational parameters of the phototherapy session (e.g., exposure time) without
entering user-specific information, and/or override the recommended parameters provided by the
algorithm. In further embodiments, the method can bypass block 420, and use non-user specific
exposure parameters for the phototherapy session.        In one embodiment, for example, each
phototherapy session can deliver approximately 50,000 IU of vitamin D to a typical user within
less than a minute of focused UVB exposure.         In other embodiments, the parameters of the
phototherapy session may differ.
[0046]     As further shown in Figure 4, the method 400 can include generating focused UVB
rays within a predetermined spectrum (block 430). For example, a filter and/or a suitable UV
radiation source can emit UVB radiation within a narrow bandwidth (e.g., a bandwidth of about
6-10 nm) generally centered at a wavelength (e.g., 297 nm, 302 nm, etc.) that facilitates efficient
vitamin D production through the skin. In one embodiment, the predetermined spectrum ranges
from approximately 290 nm to approximately 310 nm. In other embodiments, the predetermined
spectrum can be broader or narrower.
                                               -14-

[0047]      Filtering and/or otherwise generating the focused UVB rays can deliver a dose of
vitamin D to the user in a relatively short amount of time (block 440). For example, the method
400 can deliver a weekly dose of vitamin D (e.g., 700,000 IU)within 2 minutes. The vitamin D
dose provided by the apparatus can be approximated by the previously provided user-specific
characteristics and the operating parameters of the apparatus.       To obtain different vitamin D
doses, for example, the method 400 can include increasing the intensity of the UVB rays within
the predetermined spectrum and/or focusing the predetermined spectrum more closely toward
the wavelength associated with vitamin D synthesis. The exposure time can also be adjusted to
change the vitamin D dose. In further embodiments, the method 400 can also include adjusting
the parameters of the phototherapy session to limit the MED the user is exposed to and/or other
suitable steps associated with providing vitamin D phototherapy.
[0048]      Figure 5A is an isometric view of a phototherapeutic apparatus 500 ("apparatus 500")
for focused UVB radiation configured in accordance with another embodiment of the present
technology. The apparatus 500 includes several features generally similar to the features of the
apparatus described above with respect to Figures 1A-ID. For example, the apparatus includes a
plurality of focused UVB radiation fixtures or assemblies 51 Oa ("radiation assemblies 51 Oa")
that emit energy within a predetermined wavelength spectrum (e.g., about 293-301 nm, 298-306
nm, etc.).    In the illustrated embodiment, the radiation assemblies 510a are carried by two
housings, arms or columns (identified individually as a first column 530a and a second column
530b, and referred to collectively as columns 530) that are mounted on or otherwise attached to a
pedestal or base 532, and the radiation assemblies 510a are directed generally inward toward a
central portion 534 of the base 532.       The base 532 and the columns 530 together define an
irradiation zone in which a human patient can be exposed to focused UVB energy emitted by the
radiation assemblies 510a.       When a user (e.g., a human patient) stands on or is otherwise
positioned at the central portion 534 of the base 532, the radiation assemblies 510a can irradiate
the user's skin to stimulate vitamin D production in the skin during a phototherapy session. In
various embodiments, the central portion 534 of the base 532 and/or the columns 530 may rotate
relative to each other (e.g., the columns 530 may rotate around the central portion 534) to expose
all sides of the user's body to the energy emitted by the radiation assemblies 51 Oa.
[0049]      In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5A, the apparatus 500 includes eight radiation
assemblies 510a in each column 530 that emit energy at substantially similar wavelengths and
similar intensities.   In certain embodiments, the radiation assemblies 510a in the first column
                                                 -15-

530a can be vertically offset from the radiation assemblies 510a in the second column 530b to
prevent the irradiation from radiation assemblies 510a of the first column 530a from directly
overlapping the irradiation from the radiation assemblies 510a of the second column 530b. For
example, the radiation assemblies 510a in the first column 530a can be offset from radiation
assemblies 510a in the second column 510ab by about one radius of an individual radiation
assembly 510a. This staggering of the radiation assemblies 510a can provide a more uniform
intensity of irradiation along the length of the columns 530 and prevent certain areas of a user's
skin from being exposed to more irradiation than others. In other embodiments, the apparatus
500 can include columns 530 with fewer than or more than eight radiation assemblies 510a, a
single column 530 of radiation assemblies 510a, more than two columns 530 of radiation
assemblies 510a (e.g., four columns, six columns, etc.), and/or the radiation assemblies 510a can
be arranged in other suitable configurations. For example, the radiation assemblies 5 10a can be
carried by a housing (e.g., the housing 102 of Figures 1A-IC) and directed generally inward
toward an enclosed space defined by the housing.
[0050]      Similar to the apparatus 500 discussed above with reference to Figures lA-iD, the
apparatus 500 of Figure 5A can emit high intensity focused UVB radiation to facilitate vitamin
D production in the skin during relatively short phototherapy sessions.           For example, the
apparatus 500 can provide a sufficient amount of irradiation during a one-minute phototherapy
session to stimulate the production of a weekly or monthly dose of vitamin D. The exposure
time of each phototherapy session can be selected based on the on the user's skin type (e.g., as
defined by the Fitzpatrick scale) and the intensity of the radiation assemblies 51 Oa. For example,
the lighter the user's skin tone, the less exposure time necessary to obtain the desired level of
vitamin D synthesis in the user's skin. As another example, the higher the intensity of the
irradiation provided by the apparatus 500, the less exposure time necessary to obtain the desired
irradiation for vitamin D production. In various embodiments, the duration of the phototherapy
sessions can also be selected to at least reduce the likelihood that users experience sunburn after
the phototherapy session. For example, the exposure time to UVB irradiation can be limited to a
user-specific MED of 1.0 or less (e.g., an MED of 0.75). In other embodiments, the exposure
time of apparatus 500 can be determined using other suitable parameters for UVB irradiation
and/or vitamin D synthesis.
[0051]     As shown in Figure 5A, each radiation assembly 510a can include a radiation source
512, a reflector 536 partially surrounding the radiation source 512, and an optical filter 538
                                                 -16-

forward of the radiation source 512. Figure 5B is an enlarged partially schematic side view of a
radiation assembly 510a of Figure 5A configured in accordance with an embodiment of the
present technology. As shown in Figure 5B, the radiation source 512 can emit energy (e.g., UV
light; as indicated by the solid lines), and at least some of the energy can contact the reflector
536 (e.g., a mirrored substrate or coating) before exiting the radiation assembly 510a.            The
reflector 536 can divert or otherwise direct the light forward (e.g., as indicated by the solid lines)
toward the filter 538 where light within a predetermined bandwidth (e.g., about 292-302 nm) can
exit the radiation assembly 510a (e.g., as indicated by the broken lines).          In the illustrated
embodiment, the reflector 536 is curved around the radiation source 512 such that the light
emitted by the radiation source 512 collaminates upon contact with the reflector 536.              The
collaminated beam of light can then travel forward toward the filter 538, and pass through the
filter 538 at the same angle of incidence (e.g., 00) to provide substantially uniform filtering of the
light.
[0052]      In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5B, the radiation source 512 is a metal-halide
lamp, which is a type of HID gas discharge lamp that generates light by producing an electric arc
through a gaseous mixture between two electrodes 513 in an arc tube or envelope 515. The arc
length (i.e., about the distance between the electrodes 513) of the metal-halide lamp can be
relatively small with respect to radiation assembly 51 Oa as a whole such that the metal-halide
lamp acts similar to a point source to facilitate collamination of the light.              In certain
embodiments, for example, the electrodes 513 can be spaced apart from each other such that the
metal-halide lamp has an arc length of about 10-12 mm (e.g., about 11 mm, about 11.5 mm,
etc.).   In other embodiments, the metal-halide lamp can have larger or smaller arc lengths
depending on the configuration of the metal-halide lamp and the sizing of the other components
of the radiation assembly 510a (e.g., the reflector 536).      Metal-halide lamps typically have a
ramp up period to warm up to an operating temperature. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the
radiation assembly 510a can include shutters or other covers (not shown) that temporarily
enclose or insulate the radiation source 512 for a time period (e.g., about 2 minutes, about 1
minute, etc.) to allow the metal-halide lamp to quickly ramp up to its operating temperature.
[0053]      In various embodiments, the gas mixture in the arc tube 515 can be selected to
increase the UVB content of the emissions of the metal-halide lamp.            For example, the gas
mixture can be doped to generate about 6% of the total emissions in the UVB range (e.g., about
280-315 nm) in comparison to normal tanning bed lamps that have about 1% of their emissions
                                                  -17-

in the UVB range. Suitable gas mixtures for increased UVB content are available from Heraeus
Nobelight of Plainview, New York. The increased UVB content of the emissions can increase
the intensity of the UVB emitted by the radiation assembly 51 0a, and therefore may decrease the
overall exposure time necessary to achieve a desired vitamin D dose.
[0054]      As shown in Figure 5B, the radiation assembly 51 0a can further include an optional
cover or shield 540 between the radiation source 512 and the filter 538 to at least substantially
prevent light from exiting the radiation assembly 510a without first propagating off of the
reflector 538.    In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the shield 540 is a tubular body
spaced apart from the radiation source 512 (e.g., using stand-offs similar to the stand-offs 114 of
Figure ID) and positioned around a portion of the radiation source 512 forward of the arc tube
515. The shield 540 can block light that propagates forward from the arc tube 513 such that the
light first contacts the reflector 538 before exiting the radiation assembly 510a. In this manner,
the shield 540 can promote collamination of light by the reflector 536 before the light contacts
the filter 538.     In other embodiments, the shield 540 can have other suitable shapes or
configurations that prevent light from propagating directly forward through the filter 538.
[0055]      The filter 538 can be a narrow pass filter that prevents UVB radiation outside of a
predetermined bandwidth from passing through the filter 538. For example, the filter 538 can at
least substantially block UVB radiation outside of a 10 nm spectrum centered at about 297 nm
(i.e., about 292-302 nm). In other embodiments, the filter 538 can at least substantially block
UVB radiation outside of a narrower bandwidth (e.g., a 6 nm spectrum, an 8 nm spectrum, etc.),
a wider bandwidth (e.g., a 12 nm spectrum), and/or the spectrum can be centered around another
suitable UVB wavelength (e.g., 298 nm, 300 nm, 302 nm, etc.).
[0056]      As shown in Figure 5B, the filter 538 can include a substrate 542 (e.g., glass, plastic,
etc.) and at least one interference coating 544 applied to the substrate 542. For example, the
coating 544 can be sprayed onto the substrate 542 and/or otherwise disposed on the substrate 542
using methods known to those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, the substrate 542 can
be made from a material (e.g., glass) that blocks at least some of the UV light emitted by the
radiation source 512. For example, the substrate 542 can be made from an absorption glass that
blocks UV radiation below, for example, about 290 nm. The coating 544 (e.g., one or more
optical coatings) can be applied to the substrate 542 to provide additional filtering of energy
outside of the predetermined bandwidth. For example, the coating 544 may provide a higher
                                                 -18-

degree of precision in filtering the energy outside of a predetermined spectrum than provided by
the substrate 542 such that the substrate 542 and the coating 544 together form a narrow pass
filter. In certain embodiments, for example, a first coating can be applied to the substrate 542 to
block light with wavelengths less than the minimum wavelength of the predetermined spectrum,
and a second coating can be applied to the substrate 542 to block light with wavelengths higher
than the maximum wavelength of the predetermined spectrum.               In other embodiments, the
substrate 542 or the coating 544 can alone provide suitable filtering of light outside of the
predetermined spectrum. Substrates 542 and coatings 544 that provide at least some filtering of
UV radiation outside of a predetermined spectrum are available from Schott of Elmsford, New
York.
[0057]      In various embodiments, other portions of the radiation assembly 51 Oa can include an
interference coating that blocks at least some radiation outside of the desired wavelength
spectrum. For example, an outer bulb 517 of the metal-halide lamp can include an interference
coating that blocks at least some UV radiation outside the UVB spectrum from exiting the metal
halide lamp. A coating, for example, can be applied to the outer bulb 517 to block some of the
emissions in the UVC range (e.g., about 100-280 nm) and inhibit ozone from forming. In this
embodiment, the radiation source 512 narrows the spectrum of light exposed to the filter 538,
and therefore the filter 538 need only be concerned with further narrowing the bandwidth of light
permitted to pass through the filter 538.
[0058]      Figure 5C is an enlarged partially schematic side view of a focused UVB radiation
assembly 51Ob ("radiation assembly 51Ob") configured in accordance with another embodiment
of the present technology. The radiation assembly 51Ob can include features generally similar to
the features of the radiation assembly 500a described above with respect to Figure 5B.           For
example, the radiation assembly 51Ob includes the UV radiation source 512, the reflector 536 at
least partially surrounding the radiation source 512, the filter 538, and the shield 540 between the
radiation source 512 and the filter 538. The radiation source 512 can be a metal-halide lamp that
functions substantially as a point source relative to the radiation assembly 510b, and emits
energy radially outward (e.g., as indicated by the solid lines of Figure 5C). The shield 540 can
deflect or otherwise redirect energy emitted from the radiation source 512 back toward the
reflector 536 such that the reflector 536 can at least substantially collaminate the light before it
passes through the filter 538. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5C, the shield 540 has a
substantially hemispherical shape and is connected to a base portion 546 of the metal-halide
                                                 -19-

lamp with a stand-off 548 (e.g., a rod, a bar, etc.) that extends from the base portion 546 to the
shield 540. In other embodiments, the shield 540 can have other suitable configurations to block
energy from exiting the radiation assembly 510b without first contacting the collaminating
reflector 536.
[0059]     Figure 6 is an exemplary graphical representation of the relative radiation intensity of
a focused UVB radiation assembly with a metal-halide UV source (e.g., the radiation assemblies
510a and 510b described above with respect to Figures 5A-5C) compared to the relative
radiation intensity of the sun. More specifically, curve 601 (shown as a broken line) represents
the intensity of the metal-halide radiation assembly, curve 603 (shown as a solid line) represents
the intensity of the sun measured at about noon during the summer in Melbourne, Australia, and
curve 605 represents the action spectrum of UV radiation known to promote vitamin D
production in the skin. As illustrated in Figure 6, the metal-halide radiation assembly emits UV
light primarily between about 292-302 nm (e.g., focused at about 297 nm), and therefore most of
the emissions are within the action spectrum 605 for vitamin D production. In contrast, despite
being measured at one of the sun's peak energy times and locations, solar energy has a relatively
low intensity of UV light within the UVB spectrum (i.e., about 280-315 nm), and has a relatively
high intensity of UV light in the UVA spectrum (i.e., about 315-400 nm). For example, 99.7%
of the UV emissions from the metal-halide radiation assembly can be within the focused UVB
range, whereas only about 3.4% of the solar emissions are within the focused UVB range.
Accordingly, phototherapeutic apparatuses that include the metal-halide radiation assemblies
depicted in Figure 6 can emit UV energy with a much higher UVB content and intensity than
normal sun exposure.      This concentrated UVB radiation can be used to promote vitamin D
production in the skin, and do so in a much shorter exposure time than can be provided by the
sun. For example, in certain embodiments, the UVB irradiation that is provided by about 38
minutes of sun exposure (at peak times) can be provided by less than a minute (e.g., 58 seconds)
of exposure to the metal-halide radiation assembly. In addition, the high intensity of the UVB
radiation provided by the metal-halide radiation assembly can facilitate significantly more
vitamin D synthesis in the skin than the lower intensity UVB radiation provided by the sun. In
certain embodiments, for example, the metal-halide radiation assembly can provide at least three
times the production of vitamin D in the skin than can be obtained from the sun (e.g., 74,500 IU
via focused UVB radiation compared to 20,000 IU equivalent via solar energy).           Moreover,
despite the high concentration of UVB radiation, the focused UVB radiation assembly exposes a
                                                -20-

subject (e.g., a human patient) to less overall UV energy during a phototherapy session than sun
exposure (e.g., 62 times less UV energy than the sun) because much of the UV radiation outside
the predetermined spectrum is filtered out by the focused UVB radiation assembly (e.g., via the
filter 538 of Figures 5A-5C).     Accordingly, the focused UVB radiation assembly provides a
substantially more efficient means for producing vitamin D in the skin than the sun, and does so
without the geographic and weather-dependent initiations of sun exposure.
[0060]      Figure 7 is a front elevational view of a focused UVB radiation assembly 710
("radiation assembly 710") for a phototherapeutic apparatus configured in accordance with a
further embodiment of the present technology. The radiation assembly 710 can include several
features generally similar to the features of the radiation assemblies 110, 510a and 510b
described above with respect to Figures ID, 5B and 5C. For example, the radiation assembly
710 can include a UV radiation source 712, a reflector 736 positioned behind and partially
around the radiation source 712, and a filter 738 forward of the radiation source 712. In the
illustrated embodiment, radiation source 712 is a xenon lamp 750, which produces a pulsed or
continuous beam of light 752 in a tube by passing electricity through ionionized xenon gas at
high pressure. The xenon lamp 750 can be coupled to a power source (e.g., a 16 kW power
source; not shown), and forced air can be supplied from one or both ends of the radiation
assembly 710 for cooling. Xenon lamps inherently emit energy with a high UVB content, and
therefore facilitate the focused UVB irradiation provided by the radiation assembly 710.
Suitable xenon lamps (e.g., pulsed linear xenon lamps) for the radiation assembly 710 are
available from Heraeus Nobelight GmbH of Hanau, Germany.
[0061]      As shown in Figure 7, the xenon lamp 750 can be an elongated structure that emits a
linear beam of UV light 752. For example, the xenon lamp 750 can have a diameter of about 8
mm and a length of about 165 mm such that can extend along the height or length of a
phototherapeutic apparatus (e.g., the phototherapeutic apparatuses 100 and 500 of Figures 1A
and 5A).    In other embodiments, the xenon lamp can be longer or shorter length and/or have
smaller or larger diameters. The reflector 736 (e.g., a barrel reflector) can also be an elongated
structure that extends along the length of the xenon lamp 750 to direct light forward toward the
filter 738 where filtered UVB light exits the radiation assembly. The filter 738 can include an
absorption glass or other type of substrate that blocks energy below a certain wavelength (e.g.,
below about 290 nm) and an interference coating can block energy with higher wavelengths
(e.g., above about 306 nm).
                                                 -21-

[0062]      The radiation assembly 710 with the xenon lamp 750 can be used in conjunction with
or in lieu of the metal-halide lamps in the phototherapeutic apparatuses 100 and 500 described
above. For example, the radiation assembly 710 can be carried by a column (e.g., one of the
columns 530 of the phototherapeutic apparatus of Figure 5A), and the xenon lamp 750 can be
configured to generate a beam of light that extends substantially along the length of the column.
During operation, one or more of the radiation assemblies 710 can be rotated around a base (e.g.,
the central portion 534 of the base 532 of Figure 5A) to provide focused UVB radiation to a
subject (e.g., a human patient) standing on the base.        In other embodiments, one or more
radiation assemblies 710 can be incorporated into a housing (e.g., the housing 102 of Figure 1A)
and configured to direct emissions toward an enclosed space provided by the housing.
[0063]      Figure 8 is an exemplary graphical representation of the relative radiation intensity of
a focused UVB radiation assembly with a pulsed xenon UV source (e.g., the radiation assembly
710 of Figure 7) compared to the relative radiation intensity of the sun. Curve 801 (shown as a
broken line) represents the intensity of the xenon lamp radiation assembly, curve 803 (shown as
a solid line) represents solar intensity (measured at about noon during the summer in Melbourne,
Australia), and curve 805 represents the action spectrum for vitamin D production in the skin.
As shown in Figure 8, the solar spectrum (as defined by the area under the curve 803) has very
little output (e.g., about 3.4%) within vitamin D action spectrum 805. In contrast, almost all of
the output (e.g., over 98%) of the xenon lamp radiation assembly is within the vitamin D action
spectrum 805. In addition, the intensity of UVB radiation provided by the xenon lamp radiation
assembly is much higher than that provided by solar energy.         Accordingly, the xenon lamp
radiation assembly can provide focused UVB radiation within the vitamin D action spectrum
805 that facilitates vitamin D synthesis in the skin in significantly shorter exposure times than
can be provided by solar energy. For example, the UVB radiation provided by one xenon lamp
radiation assembly in less than one minute (e.g., 57 seconds) is equivalent to over 30 minutes
(e.g., 38 minutes) of sun exposure.
[0064]      In various embodiments, the phototherapeutic apparatuses 100 and 500 described
above can include other types of UV radiation sources (e.g., radiation sources 112, 512 and 712
of Figures ID, 5B, 5C and 7) that, in combination with optional filters, can provide focused
UVB irradiation within a predetermined spectrum. For example, the UV radiation source can be
comprised of a plurality of LEDs (e.g., thousands of LEDs) that emit light at a particular
wavelength (e.g., 295 nm, 297 nm, 300 nm, etc.).           Suitable LEDs are available from, for
                                                 -22-

example, Sensor Electronic Technology, Inc. of Columbus, South Carolina.                    In certain
embodiments, one or more LEDs can be arranged in individual radiation assemblies (e.g., similar
to the metal-halide lamps of Figures 5A-5C). In other embodiments, the LEDs can be arranged
in elongated rows and/or columns extending along the length of the phototherapeutic apparatus
(e.g., similar to the xenon lamp of Figure 7).       The substantially monochromatic output of the
LEDs may limit the amount of filtering necessary to provide UVB radiation within a
predetermined spectrum. In addition, LEDs have relatively low power consumption (e.g., in
comparison to HID lamps), and therefore inherently provide power savings.                    In further
embodiments, the UV radiation source can be comprised of excimer lamps that can emit light
within a narrow spectral range (e.g., the excimer lamps available from Ushio of Cypress,
California) and/or other suitable UV radiation sources that can be manipulated for focused UVB
radiation.

Conclusion
[0066]        From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the
technology have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications
may be made without deviating from the disclosure.           For example, various embodiments
disclosed herein include filters that focus UVB radiation around 297 nm. However, in other
embodiments, the filters can focus UVB radiation around other wavelengths that enable vitamin
D production in the skin and/or provide therapeutic effects for other diseases or disorders treated
via the skin (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, etc.). Certain aspects of the new technology described in
the context of particular embodiments may be combined or eliminated in other embodiments.
For example, the metal-halide UV source described in Figures 5A-5C and/or the xenon UV
source described in Figure 7 can be used in lieu of or in conjunction with the UV radiation
source for the phototherapeutic apparatus of Figures 1A-iC. Additionally, although advantages
associated with certain embodiments of the new technology have been described in the context
of those embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages and not all
embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the technology.
Accordingly, the disclosure and associated technology can encompass other embodiments not
expressly shown or described herein.
