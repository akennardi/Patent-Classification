   Field of the Invention
15
   The present invention relates to a gaming system, a method
   of gaming, a game controller and computer program code.
   Background to the Invention
20
   It is known to provide a gaming system which comprises a
   game controller arranged to randomly display several
   symbols from a predetermined set of symbols and to
   determine a game outcome such as a game win based on the
25 displayed symbols.                  Such gaming systems may commonly be
   implemented as a stepper machine provided with reels with
   each reel carrying several symbols of the set, or a video
   machine wherein selected symbols are displayed on virtual
   reels on a video display.
30
   While such gaming systems provide users with enjoyment, a
   need exists for alternative gaming systems in order to
   maintain or increase player enjoyment.
35 Summary of the Invention
   In accordance with a first aspect of the present
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                             - 2
   invention, there is provided a method of gaming
   comprising:
                            providing one or more reels in a spinning reel
   game, the reels being displayed as three dimensional and
 5 displayed as provided with game symbols along and around
   the reels;
                            displaying spinning of the reels and thereby
   sequentially displaying at least some of the game symbols
   displayed as provided along the reels;
10                          displaying rotating of the reels and thereby
   sequentially displaying at least some of the game symbols
   displayed as provided around the reels;
                            stopping the spinning and the rotating of each of
   the reels at a respective stop position;                and
15                          determining a game outcome based on at least some
   of the game symbols displayed when each of the reels is in
   its respective stop position.
   In one particular embodiment, the method includes
20 displaying the reels as toruses.
   Thus, one or more spinning reels are provided that both
   spin and rotate.                 It should be understood that, herein,
   the term "spin" refers to the motion of a reel that is
25 typically observed in spinning reel games of the
   background art, whereas "rotate" refers to the motion of a
   toroidal reel whereby an outer surface of a reel
   progressively becomes an inner face and vice versa                 (as is
   further explained below).
30
   In one particular embodiment, the method includes
   displaying the reels as provided with game symbols inside
   the reels.
35 In one embodiment, the method includes displaying the
   reels as spinning from top to bottom.                 This motion is
   comparable to the motion of spinning reels in spinning
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                          - 3
   reels games of the background art.              The reels can be
   displayed to spin at different speeds, displayed to rotate
   at different speeds, or both.
 5 In a certain embodiment, the method includes displaying
   the reels as rotating from left to right or from right to
   left.            This motion would therefore commonly be -   or appear
   to a player to be - perpendicular to the top to bottom
   spinning of a reel.              Combined, it should be noted,
10 spinning from top to bottom and rotating from left to
   right or from right to left may create the illusion that
   game symbols are moving somewhat diagonally.
   In one embodiment, the method includes providing the
15 spinning reels with circular cross sections, that is, that
   the spinning reels are shaped like doughnuts.
   In one embodiment, the method includes providing the
   spinning reels with polygonal cross sections             (such as
20 square, triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal cross
   sections).
   In one embodiment, the method includes stopping the reels
   from rotating before stopping the reels from spinning.
25
   In a particular embodiment, the method includes stopping
   the reels from rotating or spinning temporarily during a
   game.            During such a temporary stop, the reels may in
   effect change their direction of rotation or spin.
30
   The method may include displaying nudging of the reels,
   whether from top to bottom (or vice versa),             left to right
    (or vice versa) or any combination of these directions.
35 Thus, nudging - and other reel movements - can be
   implemented according to this aspect of the invention.
   The nudging can be vertical or horizontal or in a
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

   combination of directions, owing to the ability of the
   reels to rotate as well as spin.                       The eligibility of a
   player to nudge one or more reels may follow known
   criteria, such as by purchasing a nudge, only when certain
 5 symbol combinations are displayed, only in features, only
   for special players, etc.                       Nudges may be made available on
   a restricted basis                     (such as in one direction only) or a
   more extensive basis                      (up to four directions),  accordingly.
   The instigation of the nudge may be either automatic or by
10 player instruction.                      As nudge may be available in both
   horizontal                   (i.e. rotational) or vertical     (i.e. spin)
   directions, additional button functions may be provided so
   that a player can place the precise nudge instruction
   desired, including - where desired or permitted
15 simultaneously horizontally and vertically.
   The method may include displaying one or more of the game
   symbols as held symbols, or one or more of the reels as
   held reels.                      The method may include providing a hold and
20 spin feature, whereby a player can arrest one or more
   reels          (from spinning, rotating or both) and allow the
   remaining reels to move                      (spinning, rotating or both).
   In certain embodiments, the method may include displaying
25 the reels as transparent or partially transparent.
   The method may include displaying one or more additional
   game symbols, such as within one or more of the reels.
   The method may include displaying the additional game
30 symbols on respective objects (such as balls),                       as separate
   objects, or on one or more additional reels                       (which may be
   displayed, for example, behind or within the reels, or
   in some cases - nested within each other).                        The additional
   game symbols may be displayed as moving within, outside,
35 or through the reels, or combinations of these, including
   from being associated with (such as inside) one of the
   reels to being associated with (such as inside) another of
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                             -5
   the reels.
   The additional reels may be strips (i.e. two dimensional)
   or three dimensional, and both two dimensional reels and
 5 three dimensional additional reels may be displayed
   successively or simultaneously.                 Both two and three
   dimensional additional reels may be displayed as rotating
   as well as spinning.                 The reels and the additional reels
   may move simultaneously or separately, and some additional
10 reels may move separately from other additional reels.
   Additional reel creation, activation or control may be
   according to predefined rules, in response to player
   intervention, or both.
15 In some embodiments, some or all of the reels are
   displayed as compound reels, each comprising an inner two
   or three-dimensional reel and an outer at least partially
   transparent three-dimensional reel, all provided with game
   symbols.                 The inner reel (or reels) may spin and the outer
20 reel         (or reels) rotate, or vice versa.         For example, in
   one embodiment the method includes displaying each of the
   reels as a compound reel comprising an inner three
   dimensional reel displayed as provided with game symbols
   and an outer partially transparent three-dimensional reel
25 displayed as provided with game symbols, at least some of
   the game symbols provided on the inner reel visible
   through the outer reel, the method including displaying
   spinning of the outer reel and rotating of the inner reel
    (or vice versa).
30
   The method may include displaying one or more of the reels
   as altering in shape.                 In such embodiments, the method may
   include displaying the number or distribution of the game
   symbols as altering.                 For example, one or more of the
35 reels may be displayed as being transformed such that a
   5x3 matrix of game symbols                (i.e. 5 symbols along a reel
   and 3 symbols around a reel are contained within a player
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                             - 6
   viewable window) are transformed into a 5x4 matrix of game
   symbols.
   In accordance with a second aspect of the present
 5 invention, there is provided a game controller for a
   gaming system, the game controller arranged to:
                            provide one or more reels in a spinning reel
   game, the reels being displayed as three dimensional and
   displayed as provided with game symbols along and around
10 the reels;
                            display spinning of the reels and thereby
   sequentially display at least some of the game symbols
   displayed as provided along the reels;
                            display rotating of the reels and thereby
15 sequentially display at least some of the game symbols
   displayed as provided around the reels;
                            stop the spinning and the rotating of each of the
   reels at a respective stop position;                and
                            determine a game outcome based on at least some
20 of the game symbols displayed when each of the reels is in
   its respective stop position.
   In one particular embodiment, the game controller is
   arranged to display the reels as toruses.
25
   In one embodiment, the game controller is arranged to
   display the reels as spinning from top to bottom, and to
   display the reels as rotating from left to right, from
   right to left or from left to right and from right to
30 left.
   In one embodiment, the game controller is arranged to stop
   the reels from rotating before stopping the reels from
   spinning.

   Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
25
   According to embodiments of the invention there is
   provided a gaming system in which a player plays a
   spinning reel type game or games.              An award is determined
   for the game or games.              The reels spin about an axis in a
30 conventional manner to display a sequence of symbols and
   in due course may form a winning pattern (such as a win
   line).              According to embodiments of the present invention,
   the reels are each of apparent three-dimensional, torus
   form.            In one example, the torus has a circular cross
35 section, and in another example a square cross section.
   It will be appreciated, however, that essentially any
   cross section can be used provided it is suitable for
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                - 10
   displaying the symbols.
   The gaming system may be provided in a number of different
   forms.
 5
   In a first form, a stand-alone gaming machine is provided
   in which all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
10 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
15 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
20 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
25 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.                    For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.                    For example,
30 the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on.                    Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
35
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components.                    Referring to figure 1, at the
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                             - 11
   broadest level the core components are a player interface
   12 and a game controller 14, as illustrated schematically
   at 10 in figure 1.
 5 Player interface 12 is arranged to enable manual
   interaction between a player and the gaming system and for
   this purpose includes the input/output components required
   for the player to enter instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
10 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 16 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 18 and a game
   play mechanism 20 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions.
15
   Game controller 14 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 22
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
20 display.                 Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 24 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                 a
25 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
30 machine 30 according to another embodiment of the
   invention is shown schematically at 30 in figure 2.
   Gaming machine 30 includes a console 32 having a display
   34 on which is displayed representations of a game 36 that

   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
 5 card.            A player marketing module having a reading device
   may also be provided for the purpose of reading a player
   tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty program.
   The player tracking device may be in the form of a card,
   flash drive or any other portable storage medium capable
10 of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 46 may carry artwork 48 including, for example,
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.                     Further

   an exemplary memory 66.                     Memory 66 includes RAM 66A, EPROM
   66B and a mass storage device 66C.                     RAM 66A typically
   temporarily holds program files for execution by the
 5 processor 64 and related data.                     EPROM 66B may be a boot
   ROM device and/or may contain some system or game related
   code.            Mass storage device 66C is typically used to store
   game programs, the integrity of which may be verified
   and/or authenticated by processor 64 using protected code
10 from EPROM 66B or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the

   network 102 that may be, for example, an Ethernet network.
20 Gaming machines 104, shown arranged in three banks 106 of
   two gaming machines 104 in figure 5, are connected to the
   network 102.                     Gaming machines 104 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as gaming machines
   30,        60 shown in figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified
25 functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.                     While banks 106 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
30 One or more displays 108 may also be connected to the
   network 102.                     Displays 108 may, for example, be associated
   with one or more banks 106 of gaming machines.                     Displays

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 110 of gaming
   system 100 implements part of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine 104 and gaming machine 104
   implements part of the game.                     With this embodiment, as
 5 both the game server and the gaming machine implement part
   of the game, they collectively provide a game controller.
   A database management server 112 may manage storage of
   game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 104 in a database 112A.
10 Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 114 will
   be provided to carry out the accounting in respect of the
   Jackpot game.                    A loyalty program server 116 may also be
   provided.
15
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 110 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 104 and gaming machine 104 essentially provides
   only the player interface.                     With this embodiment, game
20 server 110 provides the game controller.                     Gaming machine
   104 receives player instructions, passes these to game
   server 110, which then processes them and returns game
   play outcomes to gaming machine 104 for display.                     In a
   thin client embodiment, gaming machines 104 may be
25 computer terminals, such as PCs running software that
   provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
30 administration of gaming system 100 including, for
   example, a gaming floor management server 118, and a
   licensing server 120 to monitor the use of licences
   relating to particular games.                     An administrator terminal
   122 is provided to allow an administrator to run network
35 102 and the devices connected to the network.
   Gaming system 100 may communicate with other gaming

   systems, with other local networks such as a corporate
   network, with a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 124, or a combination of
   these.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of gaming system 100 may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.                   For example, elements
10 may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.                   For example, game server
   110 could run a random generator engine.                   Alternatively, a
   separate random number generator server could be provided.
   Further, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a
15 plurality of games servers could be provided to run
   different games or a single game server may run a
   plurality of different games as required by the terminals.
   As discussed above, embodiments are provided according to
20 the present invention that are implemented in relation to
   a spinning reel type game, the gaming systems for
   implementing these games having a video display.
   According to these embodiments, the reels of the spinning
   reel type games are each of three-dimensional, torus form.
25 An example of such a video display with exemplary reels
   according to one embodiment of the invention is shown
   schematically at 130 in figure 6.                   Video display 130 has a
   viewable region 132 in which are displayed portions of
   five reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e.                   Reels 134a,
30 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e are displayed as toroidal with
   circular cross-sections, and hence doughnut-shaped; this
   can be done by shading or otherwise rendering the reels
   appropriately.                   For example, viewable region 132 may be
   enlarged so that upper and lower peripheries 136a, 136b of
35 reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e are shown as curved.
   In addition, game symbols visible along reels 134a, 134b,
   134c, 134d, 134e are progressively foreshortened towards
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                               - 17
   upper and lower peripheries 136a, 136b, consistent with
   the toroidal form of the reels.                    Reels 134a, 134b, 134c,
   134d, 134e are displayed to appear to spin from top to
   bottom during game play.

   Figure 7 is another schematic view of the player interface
   12 and a game controller 14 of figure 1, with more detail
   shown in the game controller 14.                    Specifically, processor
   12 of game controller 14 includes a display controller
10 140, a spinning module 142 and a rotation module 144.                     The
   display controller 140 controls the view that is displayed
   on displays 34, 82; spinning module 142 controls the
   manner in which reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e are
   displayed when displayed to spin and rotation module 144
15 controls the manner in which reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d,
   134e are displayed when displayed to rotate.                    Processor 12
   also includes an outcome determiner 146                   (typically
   receiving input from the random number generator),                    for
   determining game outcomes.                    Display controller 140,
20 spinning module 142, rotation module 144 and outcome
   determiner 146 cooperate to display and determine the
   outcome of a game.
   In addition, memory 24 includes reel data 148 comprising
25 vertical sequence data 150 and horizontal sequence data
   152.          Vertical sequence data 150 is indicative of the
   sequence in which game symbols are to be displayed along
   each of reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e and horizontal
   sequence data 152 is indicative of the sequence in which
30 game symbols are to be displayed around each of reels
   134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e.                    This can be encoded in any
   convenient way;                  for example, vertical sequence data 150
   can indicate, for each of reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d,
   134e, four sequences of game symbols with horizontal
35 sequence data 152 indicating where each of the vertical
   sequences should commence.                    Alternatively, vertical
   sequence data 150 can indicate, for each of reels 134a,
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                               - 18
   134b, 134c, 134d, 134e, one sequence of game symbols to be
   displayed along the respective reel, with horizontal
   sequence data 152 indicating the sequence of game symbols
   to be displayed around each reel from each of the game
 5 symbols indicated in by the vertical sequence data 150.
   Although in this embodiment reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d,
   134e are displayed as toroidal with circular cross
   sections, in other embodiments, the reels may be displayed
10 with other shapes such as toroidal with square cross
   sections.                   Such an embodiment is shown schematically in
   figure 8, which depicts a video display 160 in which are
   displayed reels 134a',                  134b',  134c', 134d', 134e'. These
   reels spin in the same manner as do reels 134a, 134b,
15 134c, 134d, 134e of figure 6, and carry essentially the
   same game symbols.
   Referring to figure 7, game play instructions stored in
   memory 24 control reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e to be
20 displayed to spin such that game symbols arranged along
   reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e are displayed as moving
   downwards in the viewable region 132.
   Reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e also have game symbols
25 located around their three dimensional surfaces, such that
   four game symbols correspond to each symbol position along
   any reel; hence, in the stopped configuration shown in
   figure 6, three additional game symbols are concealed or
   otherwise not displayed for each displayed game symbol.
30 Thus, reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e may be described
   as being provided with plural sets of four game symbols,
   the sets displayed along the reels with each set arranged
   around a reel.                   The overall effect is that game symbols
   are displayed both along and around the reels.
35
   The game play instructions stored in memory 24 also
   control reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e to spin or
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                 - 19
   "rotate" (as seen by the player) from left to right in the
   view of figure 6.                     This progressively brings into view
   other game symbols, and a new selection of game symbols is
   completely displayed once the reels have rotated through
 5 900.         This process is illustrated by reference to figures
   9A and 9B.                    Referring to figure 9A, after reels 134a,
   134b, 134c, 134d, 134e have rotated through 450,                      the
   original selection and a new selection of game symbols are
   both partially visible and, referring to figure 9B, after
10 reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e have rotated through a
   total         of 90',            the original selection of symbols has been
   entirely replaced in the viewable region 132 by the new
   selection of game symbols.                      A sequence of such rotations
   results in what was originally an outer face of reels
15 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e becoming an inner face, and
   vice versa.
   It should be noted that, although in this embodiment in
   the configuration of figure 6 the four game symbols at
20 each vertical position (one displayed and three at the
   same position along a reel but not displayed) are at the
   same vertical position, in other embodiments this may not
   be so.              For example, game symbols may be arranged around a
   reel in a generally helical manner.
25
   The disposition of game symbols on reels 134a, 134b, 134c,
   134d, 134e as displayed before this latter rotation is
   shown schematically in figures 10A to 10E                      (corresponding
   to the reels notionally being viewed in direction 138 in
30 figure 6).                    The player normally views reels 134a, 134b,
   134c, 134d, 134e in direction 162, so the game symbols
   shown in figures 10A to 10E are not in fact displayed in
   the configuration of these figures                     (which, indeed,
   corresponds to that of figure 6).                      The symbols shown in
35 figures 10A to 10E to the right of centre-lines 164 of
   each reel are those that are displayed once reels 134a,
   134b,         134c,            134d, 134e have rotated 90'  (viz. the
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                               - 20
   configuration shown in figure 9B).
   In play, reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e may be
   controlled to spin from top to bottom and to rotate from
 5 right to left simultaneously or sequentially; indeed, this
   motion may be in the opposite directions to those
   illustrated, or multiple directions in the course of one
   game.            Reels 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134e may spin in
   different directions, such as with all reels 134a, 134b,
10 134c, 134d, 134e spinning from top to bottom (as shown in
   figure 6),                  some rotating from left to right (as shown in
   figures 8A and 8B) and the others rotating from right to
   left.            In one particular embodiment, reels 134a, 134b,
   134c, 134d, 134e initially spin from top to bottom and
15 rotate from left to right simultaneously, but cease
   rotating - with a column of game symbols aligned centrally
   in each reel as viewed by the player (such as is shown in
   figures 6, 8 and 9B) - before ceasing to spin from top to
   bottom.                The spinning from top to bottom is then
20 controlled to stop such that a pay line is visible to the
   player.                The ceasing of left to right rotation before top
   to bottom spinning heightens the player's experience, as
   it can lead to the appearance of an apparent near miss.
   The time delay between the ceasing of left to right
25 rotation and the ceasing of top to bottom spinning is
   controlled by the game play instructions in a memory 24,
   but can be set to any desired period; in one embodiment
   this period is 3 seconds, but shorter or longer periods
   may be employed.                   This period is typically fixed for any
30 particular gaming system according to the present
   invention, but in some embodiments may be altered during a
   set of games by the game play instructions, such as on the
   basis of previous game outcomes, or randomly.
35 Although it may be preferred to display the reels as
   toroidal                (as shown in figures 6 and 8 to 9E),   in some
   embodiments the reels are displayed as essentially
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                 - 21
   straight three-dimensional figures, such as cylinders,
   tubes or rods                    (or, for example, square cross section).
   Figure 11 is a schematic view of visual display 170
   according to such an embodiment, with reels 172a, 172b,
 5 172c, 172d, 172e each in the form of a tube.                      The reels
   are rendered to appear to comprise straight tubes, so
   there is no foreshortening of game symbols towards their
   upper and lower peripheries 174a, 174b.                      Figures 12A to
   12C depict viewable region 132 with possible reels
10 according to such an embodiment, in successive positions.
   In figures 12A and 12B the reels are shown rotationally
   displaced relative to each other, illustrating the effect
   of the rotation of game symbols.                      Figure 12C depicts the
   effect on game symbols once spinning is added, and hence
15 combined with rotational movement:                     the game symbols are no
   longer in ranks either vertically or horizontal, producing
   a novel game experience.
   In certain embodiments, the reels are displayed as having
20 more complex shapes;                    they may be displayed as bent or
   curved, or forming S shape, a U shape or otherwise.                      In
   addition, in some embodiments, some or all of the reels
   are displayed as joined to one another.                      For example, an S
   shaped reel may be displayed as joined to another S shaped
25 reel or to, for example, a U shaped reel.
   As is described above, in the embodiment of figure 6, the
   reels stop with a column of game symbols aligned centrally
   in each reel as viewed by the player.                      In some
30 embodiments, however, one or more reels may have stop
   positions in which more than one game symbol displayed as
   arranged around the reel is displayed to the player, and
   the game outcome may -                    in such embodiments -  take game
   symbols in this manner into account.                      Hence, a game
35 outcome may be determined from more than two rotating
   symbols on at least one reel.                      For example, if a reel is
   of square or regular hexagonal cross section, the reel's
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                  - 22
   stop position may display two or three game symbols, and
   these - in some embodiments - may influence the game
   outcome.
 5 Figure 13 is a schematic view of visual display 180
   according to such an embodiment, with reels 182a, 182b,
   182c, 182d, 182e each in the form of a torus of square
   cross section.                      Reels 182a, 182b, 182c, 182d, 182e have
   plural possible stop positions, including those shown in
10 figure 8.                   However, figure 13 depicts alternative stop
   positions in which two game symbols are displayed at each
   position along each reel.                       More complex game outcome
   determinations can then be made; for example, a bonus may
   be awarded if two identical symbols are visible (in
15 viewable region 132) at the same location along one or
   more reels.                      This is so in the illustrated example:   two
   pairs of hearts 184, 186 are displayed, on fourth reel
   182d and on fifth reel 182e respectively.                       A single game
   may include a mixture of stop positions, with one or more
20 reels stopping with a single column of displayed symbols
    (cf. figure 9B) and one or more other reels stopping with
   plural columns of displayed symbols                      (cf. figure 12).
   Numerous variations are possible according to the present
25 invention.                    For example, in the above embodiments, the
   reels are displayed as essentially opaque, with game
   symbols displayed on the outside of the reels.                       In some
   other embodiments, the reels are displayed as transparent
   or partially transparent, so that additional effects and
30 features can be provided.
   For example, a reel may be displayed as transparent and
   filled or partially filled with a fluid that is displayed
   to behave, for example, like water.                       The extent of this
35 filling can be varied with time or according to other
   parameters, with the degree of                       filling used to determine
   additional prizes, bonuses or games features.                       The filling
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                - 23
   can also be provided by other than fluids; for example,
   the reels may be progressively displayed as filled
   partially or completely - with balls or other objects.
 5 An example of such an embodiment is shown in figure 14,
   which depicts viewable region 132 with possible reels
   and various "water" levels.                     From left to right, first to
   fifth reels 188a to 188e are provided with game symbols
   along their vertical length (as are depicted) and around
10 their circumference                  (concealed in this view),    and are
   displayed as essentially transparent.                     Each is displayed
   as filled to varying levels with "water".                     First reel 188a
   is partially filled, such that only one visible game
   symbol is backed by the water.                     Third reel 188c is full,
15 and second, fourth and fifth reels 188b, 188d and 188e are
   displayed as half full.
   These final levels of the water can be used, in this
   embodiment, to determine game or prize outcomes.                      For
20 example, in one game three like symbols                    (e.g. buildings)
   may in their stop positions be located on the centre line
   of the first three reels                   (e.g. reels 188a, 188b, 188c).
   "Water" is then displayed as flowing down into all five
   reels and settling to varying levels, such as to the
25 bottom position of the first reel 188a, the top position
   of the second and fourth reels                     188b, 188d and to the
   centre position of the third and fifth reels 188c, 188e.
   The prize is evaluated with reference to these "water"
   levels: the water is behind two of the kings                     (i.e. in the
30 second and fourth reels),                   so the prize is doubled and
   doubled again.                   Eligibility for the "water" feature can be
   based on any suitable criterion or criteria, such as would
   be appreciated by those in the art, such as by being
   purchased by a special bet, made available in all games,
35 made available only during features, or made available to
   players with a player card status.
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                  - 24
   In another example in which the reels are transparent or
   partially so, game symbols are displayed as falling down
    (or floating up) inside a reel or reels, and coming to
   rest at different locations to thereby contribute to prize
 5 evaluation.                      The game symbols can be in a variety of
   forms.              For example, the symbols may be in the form of
   indicia on objects (such as balls or stars),                     or comprise
   those objects (such as a letter-shaped object or a star
   shaped object).                      In either case, a "star" - for example
10 may be displayed as falling inside a reel and stopping,
   such as behind one or more game symbols on the reel.
   Prizes are then evaluated and may pay additional value if
   such a symbol is behind or otherwise aligned in a
   predefined manner with one of the game symbols on the
15 reel.
   In such embodiments, the falling symbols may be stopped
   either randomly or in response to some player intervention
   or skill.                   Similarly, in the embodiments in which a fluid
20 is displayed as filling one or more reels, players may be
   provided with the ability to intervene to enhance, inhibit
   or stop the filling.
   In certain embodiments, the falling symbols or filling
25 fluid may constitute an essentially separate game, though
   played simultaneously with the spinning and rotating reel
   game.            For example, falling game symbols in the reels may
   comprise keno balls, their stop positions determining the
   outcome of a keno game.
30
   Also, the falling (or floating) symbols or filling fluid,
   in some embodiments, trigger features, such as jackpots.
   It will also be appreciated that other features known in
35 electronic gaming machines and the games provided thereby
   can be advantageously and synergistically combined with
   the features described above.
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                                  - 25
   The basic method 190 of the above embodiments of the
   invention is summarised in figure 15.                       At step 192, the
   game play instructions commence a game, typically
 5 including receiving input from the random number generator
   for use in determining the conduct of the game.                       At step
   194, the reels are spinning from top to bottom and
   rotating from left to right simultaneously.                       This may
   create the illusion that the game symbols are moving
10 diagonally.
   At step 196, the reels spin and rotate for a predefined
   period.                At step 198, the game play instructions
   progressively slow the motion of the reels in both
15 directions.                      At step 200, the rotating of the reels from
   left to right is stopped.                       Subsequently, at step 202, the
   spin of the reels from top to bottom is stopped.
   At step 204, the game outcome is determined based on the
20 stop positions of the symbols, as finally displayed to the
   player.
   Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
25 present invention.                      For example, the reels may have
   different cross sections, such that - for example -                      reels
   of circular cross section are mixed with reels of square,
   triangular, pentagonal or other cross section.                       In
   addition, the number of symbols spaced around the
30 periphery of the reels may differ from the four described
   above.              For example, if the reels have hexagonal cross
   sections, six symbols may be spaced around each reel in
   each position.                      In such cases, non-displayed symbols may
   be partially visible even when the reels have stopped,
35 which can also heighten the player experience.
   Furthermore, a game may be provided in which one or more
   three dimensional, torus shaped reels are accompanied by
   10245776_1(GHMaters) P72442.AU.5

                                    - 26
   other reels, such as conventional, ribbon shaped reels.
   In the claims that follow and in the preceding description
   of the invention, except where the context requires
 5 otherwise owing to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   that is, to specify the presence of the stated features
   but not to preclude the presence or addition of further
10 features in various embodiments of the invention.
   Further, any reference herein to prior art is not intended
   to imply that such prior art forms or formed a part of the
   common general knowledge in any country.
