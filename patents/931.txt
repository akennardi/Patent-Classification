DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0023]    The sit to stand frame 10 shown in Figures I to 3 can be fitted to a side of a bed 12 in the
manner shown in Figures 4 and 5. The frame 10 can be used to assist a person (not shown) to move
from a seated position on a side of the bed 12 to a standing position. The frame 10 is intended for the
purpose of enabling people suffering functional decline and decreased mobility (particularly leg
strength and imbalance) to go safely from a seated position on the edge of a bed 12, to a standing
position either independently or with the assistance of one other person. The frame 10 forms an
armchair-like shape around the person whereby he or she can use the frame 10 to push themselves up
into a standing position safely and with minimal aid from an assistant.
[0024]    The frame 10 includes left and right arm members 14a, 14b separated by a transverse
member 16 coupled therebetween. The frame 10 also includes an anchoring section 18 coupled to the
arm members 14a, 14b for transferring a load of the person away from the arm members 14a, 14b to
an anchoring point 20. Upper sections 22a, 22b of the left and right arm members 14a, 14b are
supported above an upper surface 24 of a mattress 26 of the bed 12 for engagement with respective left
and right arms (not shown) of the person seated therebetween.
[0025]    The arm members 14a, 14b include transmission sections 28a, 28b coupled between the
upper sections 22a, 22b and the anchoring section 18. The transmission sections 28a, 28b support the
upper sections 22a, 22b of the arm members 14a, 14b above the upper surface 24 of the mattress 26 of
the bed 12.
[0026]    The anchoring section 18 includes left and right posts 30a, 30b extending downwardly from
respective left and right arm members 14a, 14b. The left and right posts 30a, 30b extend downwardly
towards the anchoring point 20, which in the example shown is floor or ground surface.
[0027]    The lengths Hp of the left and right posts 30a, 30b are adjustable. In the example shown,
each of the posts 30a, 30b is formed in upper and lower parts, whereby the lower part is of a suitable

                                                      4
size to slide inside the corresponding upper party to shorten the overall height of the post. The lower
post is locked into position with respect to the upper post by a fastener. Alternatively, the posts 30a.
30b are telescopic, or any other suitable configuration with adjustable lengths.
[0028]     The left and right posts 30a, 30b each include rubber feet 32 that provide a friction surface
between the frame 10 and the floor 20, reducing the risk of the frame 10 slipping.
[0029]     The upper sections 22a, 22b of the arm members 14a, 14b form top handrails that allow the
user to grasp the rails in the sealed position then push downwards through the frame 10 and stand
upright.
[0030]     The frame 10 preferably has the following dimensions:
           LEE     =       650mm
           LAE     =      440mm
           LEA     =       210mm
           LIPE           430mm
           Luc=            541 mm
           T       =       25mm
           Wss     =       630mm to 670mm
           S       =       130mm
           HRR     =       170mm to 180mm
           Hp      =      491mm to 700mm
           HPF     =       500mm
           HPA     =       250mm
[0031]     These dimensions are for an exemplary embodiment of the frame 10 and for the frame 100
(mentioned below) and of course, will vary to accommodate different sized beds and different sized
people.
[0032]     The frame 10 is preferably made from stainless steel and aluminium tubing that is bent and
welded into shape. Alternatively, the frame 10 could be made of any other suitable material and the
parts could be coupled together in any other suitable manner. The left and right arm members 14a, 14b
and the transverse member 16 are preferably integrally formed.

                                                      5
[0033]     The arm members 14a, 14b and the transverse member 16 form a three-sided base that lies
flat on the upper surface 24 of the mattress 26. The front side of the frame 10 is left open for patient
access.
[0034]     In the alternative arrangement shown in Figures 6 and 7, the left and right posts 30a, 30b of
the frame 10 extend downwardly for engagement with a frame 33 of the bed 12. The left and right
posts 30a, 30b include transverse frame engaging members 34 arranged for engagement with the
frame 33 of the bed 12. In the example shown, the frame engaging members extend between the
mattress 26 and the frame 34. The weight of the mattress 26 secures the frame 10 in position.
Alternatively, the frame engaging members 34 are adapted to be coupled to the frame 33 of the bed
with a fastener (not shown). For example, the fastener could be a clamp or a strap.
[0035]     Again, the lengths He of the left and right posts 30a, 30b are adjustable. In the example
shown, each of the posts 30a, 30b is formed in upper and lower parts, whereby the lower part is of a
suitable size to slide inside the corresponding upper party to shorten the overall height of the post. The
lower post is locked into position with respect to the upper post by a fastener. Alternatively, any other
suitable configuration with adjustable lengths.
[0036]     An alternative sit to stand frame 100 is shown in Figures 8 and 9. The alternative frame 100
includes many of the features of the frame 10 and like parts are referenced with like numbers. In
addition, the frame 100 includes two hinges hinge 102a, 102b for coupling the left and right posts 30a,
30b to respective transmission sections 28a, 28b of the frame 100.
[0037]     The hinges 102a, 102b each include first and second plates 104 separated by a gap. The posts
30a, 30b are shaped to fit between the plates 104 of respective hinges 102a, 102b. The posts 30a, 30b
are secured to the hinges 102a, 102b pivot pins 106. The pivot pins 106 allow the posts 30a, 30b to
swing between the expanded condition of use shown in Figure 8 and the collapsed condition of use
shown in Figure 9. The posts 30a, 30b are secured in the expanded condition of use by locking pins
108. Similarly, the posts 30a, 30b are secured in the collapsed condition of use by locking pins 110.
The locking pins 108 and 110 preferably extend through the plates 104 and corresponding apertures of
the posts 30a, 30b. Alternatively, the locking pins 108 and 110 extend through one plate 104 and at
least partially into corresponding apertures of the posts 30a, 30b.
[0038]     As particularly shown in Figures 10 and 11, upper sections 22a, 22b of the arm members
14a, 14b of the frame 100 are stepped in to improve stackability of the frames 100. To facilitate, this,
the arm members 14a, 14b are inclined at angle "A" from the vertical, where "A" is preferably
between 10 degrees and 15 degrees. In one embodiment. "A" is 12 degrees. Of course, the angle "A"

                                                      6
can be any other suitable angle that facilitates ease of stacking of the frames 100 one on top of the
other.
[0039]     Although it is not shown in the drawings, upper sections 22a, 22b of the arm members 14a,
14b of the frame 10 can also be stepped in to improve stackability of the frames 10 one on top of the
other. The arm members 14a, 14b are inclined at angle "A" from the vertical, where "A" is preferably
between 10 degrees and 15 degrees. "A" is preferably 12 degrees. Of course, the angle "A" can be any
other suitable angle that facilitates ease of stacking of the frames 10 one on top of the other.
[0040]     Many modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the
scope of the present invention
[0041]     Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise",
and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or
group of integers or steps.
