                           IMPROVED INSULATED BUILDING SECTION
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to buildings and in particular to insulated building sections.
The invention has been developed primarily for use as an improved insulated wall section for use
in residential or commercial building construction and will be described hereinafter with reference
to this application. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular
field of use.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an
admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in
the field.
Insulating cavities in a building section to improve thermal, acoustic and other properties by fully
filling the cavity space with an insulating material, such as fibre glass batts, is known. This
approach sometimes creates problems when service supply lines, for example, electrical wiring
or plumbing and the like are installed within the cavity. Installation of the supply lines can disrupt
the insulation layer by penetrating through it or by providing a "cutout" resulting in a lower
insulation value of the building section. If the insulation is intended to improve fire resistance of
a building section, such as a wall section, any break, or reduction in thickness of the insulating
material, could compromise the fire resistance performance.
It is desirable to provide an improved insulated building section that can accommodate installation
of service supply lines without compromising insulation performance, particularly in relation to
thermal, acoustic, fire resistance properties and the like.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages
of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

                                                     2
In one form of the invention, it is intended to provide an improved insulated building section for

Referring now to the drawings and specifically Figures 1 (a) to (h), there is shown one embodiment
following the method of construction of an improved insulated building section 100 providing a
wall section.

                                                   9
Framing section 110, as best shown in Figure 1(a), comprises a plurality of framing members 120,
each framing member comprising a first face 122 and a second face 124 and a thickness 126.
Framing members 120 may be timber or any generally accepted equivalent building material.
Width and thickness dimensions of framing members may vary according to local building
practice, with 90mm x 45mm being commonly used as nominal thickness and width dimensions
respectively. Length can be user determined to meet local regulations or local building practice
preference. For example, in Australia, there is a maximum length (equivalent to height in an
installed wall framing section) of 3000mm allowed for each storey height in a residential dwelling
when using 90mm x 35mm studs. This height can increase, for example, to 4200mm for a 90mm
x 90mm stud size and so on, so long as the required structural capacity requirements are met.
In practice, timber framing members include both studs and noggings in addition to the top and
bottom plates. In a wall section, such as that shown in Figure 1(a) studs provide vertically oriented
framing members 120a in an installed framing section, and noggings provide the horizontally
oriented intermediate framing members 120b. The top and bottom plates provide the horizontal
end framing members 120c (only the bottom plate is shown in Figure 1(a)). Stud spacings are
controlled by local building practice and/or regulation. A typical stud spacing range would be at
least 300mm, with alternate typical stud spacings ranging between approximately 400mm,
450mm or 600mm as desired by the end user. At least one framing section may also optionally
include at least one bracing member 128, to improve bracing or racking strength. Each bracing
member 128 may be made of timber, metal, plastic or other suitable building materials such as
fibre cement, plywood and the like as are known in the art.
In one construction method, at least one framing section 110 is constructed in-situ. Each framing
element 120 being fixedly connected to at least two other framing elements in its intended final
in-service position. This is the traditional construction method used by builders and is well known
in the art.  In a newer, and alternate building method, at least one framing section 110 may be
constructed remotely, and subsequently installed in a user determined position as one or more
"modular' framing section units. Construction of modular framing sections can be either carried
out at a separate location on the construction site, or at a remote location such as at a
manufacturer's premises and subsequently transported to the construction site.                During
installation of one or more 'modular' framing sections in their intended in-service position,

                                                    10
temporary bracing 196 (such as that shown in Figure 1(d)) may be used to provide temporary
support of at least one individual framing section 110.
As best shown in Figure 1(b), once framing section 110 has been constructed, it may optionally
have building wrap 127, also known as building paper or house wrap, applied to first major framing
section surface 112 by any normal accepted means, such as stapling. Building wrap 127 may be
applied after installation of framing section 110, in the case of a framing section constructed in
situ, or prior to installation, in the case of a framing section constructed remotely. If more than
one piece of building wrap is required to cover first major framing section surface 112, additional
pieces may be used, and any joins, tears or punctures sealed by use of a suitable sealing tape
(not shown). One suitable form of building wrap 127 would be a non-perforated, breathable,
reflective and glare-safe type building wrap, such as HardieWrap TM Weather Barrier.
Although not shown, it is understood that one or more trim and/or flashing element may also be
fixed through first major framing section surface 112 into framing section 110, to provide a desired
aesthetic or functional effect. Examples of such elements include corner trimming, slab edge
covering, cladding starter strip, water drainage, flashings, and the like.          These accessory
components may be positioned either under or over optional building wrap 127, as recommended
by the manufacturer or supplier.
As best shown in Figure 1(c), a cladding element 160 may be installed by positioning a first
cladding element 161 in user defined positions on, or relative to, first major framing section surface
112 and fixing through first major framing section surface 112 to framing section 110. Cladding
element 161 may be installed using any suitable means, such as for example any mechanical or
chemical means known to the person skilled in the art. In one example, the fixing means could
be mechanical fixings such as the fixing means 162 shown in Figure 1(g). One or more
subsequent cladding elements 161' can be installed in a similar way until first major framing
surface 112 is covered by cladding elements 160. In one embodiment, cladding elements 160
may be installed prior to framing section 110 being installed into its permanent, in-service position.
Such an approach is appropriate for boundary lot, or zero lot style construction techniques.
Cladding element 160 may be any suitable building cladding material known to the person skilled
in the art, for example, in some embodiments, cladding element 160 may be in panel or plank
form.   If cladding element 160 is intended to provide an exterior wall cladding, it should be a

                                                    11
material suitable for that application, such as, for example fibre cement cladding. If the wall
section is intended to provide a 60/60/60 Fire Resistance Level (FRL), then the product should
also be suited for that application. For example, it is possible to use a fibre cement panel that has
a thickness that is greater than approximately 6mm, such as James Hardie's EasyLap TM
ZeroLot T M panel which is approximately 8.5mm thick. Installation of cladding element 160 should
follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the use of any bond breaker tapes 164 (shown in
Figure 1(g)), suitable joint sealants, or flashing/trim pieces.
Cladding elements 160 may require a protective surface treatment applied onsite, such as a paint
coating, or it may be supplied with a protective treatment pre-applied.
If framing section 110 is constructed remotely, and subsequently moved into a user determined
position, levelled and plumbed prior to being fixed to structural support 105, it may be temporarily
supported in that position by means of temporary bracing 196, as best shown in Figure 1(d), until
framing section 110 is self-supporting.
As best shown in Figure 1(e), each space between adjacent framing members 120 defines a stud
bay 130, each stud bay comprises a height 140 and a width 150. First face 122 of each framing
member 120 in a constructed framing section 110, together defines a first major framing section
surface 112. Second face 124 of each framing member 120 in a constructed framing section 110,
together defines a second major framing section surface 114. Thickness 126 of each framing
member 120 in a constructed framing section 110, defines a framing section thickness 116.
Insulating element 180 is disposed in each stud bay 130. Each insulating element 180 comprises
a height 182 and width 184 which are configured to completely fill a respective height 140 and
width 150 of a (respective) stud bay 130. In one configuration, the height 182 and width 184 of
insulating element 180 are slightly larger than the corresponding height 140 and width 150 of a
respective stud bay 130 to allow a resistance fit of the insulating element 180 into the stud bay
130. It is estimated that a difference of approximately 5mm in each dimension is sufficient to
ensure that the entire height 150 or width 140 of respective stud bay 130 is completely filled such
that each installed insulating element 180 is placed slightly into compression in both directions to
maintain a "friction fit" into the stud bay and prevent dislodgement of insulating element 180 during
construction of the improved insulated wall section 100. Each insulating element 180 is installed

                                                   12
in a respective stud bay 130 by applying gentle pressure by hand to second major face 188
(Figure 1(h)), thereby urging insulating element 180 into stud bay 130 until first major face 187
(Figure 1(h)) is level with first major framing section face 112.
Insulating element 180 may be formed from a homogeneous material such as an inorganic
mineral wool. In some cases, that mineral wool may be specifically formulated and manufactured
to provide high temperature resistance, such as is required to provide resistance to fire and the
like. In one embodiment, insulating element 180 is a composite material formed by provided by
covering either one or both major faces of a mineral wool "batt" type substrate with a protective
and /or functional facing layer (not shown).
In an alternate configuration, insulating element 180 may be provided as a "pillow", where a core
of insulating inorganic wool is provided in a fabric casing, the fabric being either also insulating or
sacrificial. In one embodiment it is preferable that the sizing of any pillow form insulating element
180 is such that the insulating material within the pillow's covering material is approximately 5 mm
larger in both height and width of any corresponding stud bay 130 dimensions.
In a further embodiment, insulating element 180 may be provided in a roll or mat format, where
the user may bend, fold or otherwise manipulate the shape to meet the criteria that it completely
cover each stud bay. Similarly to a simple batt style insulating element, the roll or mat format
insulating element is sized such that it is slightly larger than the height 140 and width 150
dimensions of each stud bay 130 to provide a self-supporting, friction fit with no gaps between
the roll or mat format insulating element 180 and a surrounding framing member 120.
Referring now to Figures 1(f) to 1(h). The thickness 186 of each insulating element 180, defined
between each respective first major face 187 and second major face 188, is less than framing
section thickness 116 thereby providing cavity space 190. Cavity space 190 is defined between
second major face 188 of each insulating element 180 and second major framing section surface
114 can accommodate at least one service supply line 192, without requiring any penetration
through insulating element 180 during installation, thereby maintaining complete coverage of
height 140 and width 150 of each stud bay 130 by insulating element 180, and providing an
improved performance of the constructed insulated building section.

                                                    13
Each service supply line 192 providing one or more services from the group comprising water,
gas, electricity, lighting, communication, data transmission, security monitoring, security alerts,
automation, energy management, television, home theatre, distributed audio, heating, ventilation,
air-conditioning, vacuum cleaning, exhaust, and drainage. At least one framing member 120 in a
framing section 110 is provided with an opening 193 to allow a service supply line 192 to pass
through one or more stud bays 130 to provide one or more services to a desired location within a
constructed insulated building section 100.        Each insulating element 180 has a thickness 186
that is approximately 20-50 mm, and preferably approximately 30mm, less than the structural
framing section thickness 116. It is preferable that each service supply line 192 does not
penetrate, crush or damage insulation element 180. For example, in one embodiment, where
cavity 190 is approximately 30mm deep, each service supply line 192 should be no more than
25mm in diameter and should not penetrate, crush or damage insulation element 180.
Once any service supply line 192 has been installed, a further cladding element 170 may be
disposed on second major framing section face 114, as best shown in Figure 1(g) and fixed
through second major framing section face 114 to framing section using fixings 162, whilst taking
care not to damage any installed service supply line 192. Wherever an inlet or outlet port 194 for
each service supply line 192 is required on further cladding element 170, a penetration or opening
through further cladding element 170 can be made as desired, and the opening finished by means
of finishing plates, trims, and the like 174. If further cladding element 170 is to provide an interior
wall surface, then any suitable building product may be used. If the constructed wall section
requires a 60/60/60 FRL rating, then a building product that can provide adequate performance
in that application is required. An example of such a product is a fibre cement panelized product
which is at least 6mm thick, such as, for example, James Hardie's Villaboard TM lining.
Manufacturer's recommendations regarding the use of joint sealants and the like should be
followed to achieve the best outcome. If further cladding element 170 provides an interior wall
surface, it may be provided with an aesthetic, decorative finish, such as paint or wallpaper,
generally applied prior to completion of the building's construction.
In one embodiment, when insulating element 180 is a fire resistant mineral wool batt completely
covering each stud bay 130, and used in combination with suitable first and second fibre cement
cladding materials 160 and 170 as exemplified above, improved insulated wall section 100 can
provide a 60/60/60 FRL. An FRL of 60/60/60 refers to the time in minutes which a constructed

                                                  14
wall section will resist exposure to heat and flame without a loss of structural integrity when tested
to Australian standard test AS1530 Part 4. The FRL has 3 component properties measured:
structural adequacy, integrity, and insulation. A constructed wall section that meets a 60/60/60
FRL means that each property has been adequately maintained for 60 minutes.            In addition, the
improved performance of insulated building section 100 may be non-fire related thermal insulation
performance and/or acoustic insulation performance.
In an alternate construction method, as shown in Figure 2(a) and in cross-sectional view in Figure
2(b), at least two improved insulated building sections 100 are constructed as exterior wall
sections adjacent each other with an approximate 50mm minimum separation space 199 between
them.
Walls constructed in this method can be used in "Boundary Lot" or "Zero Lot" style dwellings
where each dwelling in row type housing is built separately to, but adjacent with, at least one other
similar dwelling with minimum separation between individual dwellings. Alternatively, in a further
embodiment the construction being built could be a new insulated building section construction
100 and a pre-existing wall section of another building 198, as best shown in Figure 2(c). In each
instance, each wall section is installed on a separate structural substrate 105, such as a concrete
slab.   In this construction style, first improved insulated wall section 100 of a first dwelling is
constructed either in-situ or remotely and installed in a user determined position. A second
improved insulated building section 100 is then constructed remotely and installed in a user
determined position adjacent to, and separated from, first improved insulated building section
100, with cladding element 160 of a first improved insulated building section 100 facing cladding
element 160 of a second improved insulated building section 100 or the existing wall structure
198. Each wall section 110 accommodates one respective service supply line 192 within
respective cavity space 190.
In another alternate construction method, such as used to construct intertenancy walls between
adjacent dwelling spaces within the same building construction, as best shown in Figure 2(d), two
improved insulated building sections 100 are constructed adjacent each other separated by a
minimum separation spacing 199 of approximately 30mm, or whatever is required under local
building regulations. In this construction style, cladding element 160 of each improved insulated
building section 100 is optional, and building wrap 127 is optionally applied to first major framing
surface 112 of each framing section 110.

                                                   15
In this construction method, each framing section 110 may be constructed on a single, common
structural substrate 105, such as a single concrete slab. In this construction method, first framing
section 110 of a first improved insulated building section 100 is constructed either in-situ, or
remotely and installed in a user determined position. Framing members 120 are fixedly connected
together, such as by means of nails, screws or any other suitable fixings as are known in the art,
to construct a first framing section 110 to user determined dimensions. In an optional step, building
wrap 127 may be disposed on first major framing surface 112 of first framing section 110 and may
be fixed to first framing section 110 by means such as stapling. If first framing section 110 is
constructed remotely, it can then be installed in its user determined position, ready to receive at
least one insulating element 180 in each stud bay 130.
Each insulating element is cut to height 182 and width 184 dimensions that are each
approximately 5 mm larger than the corresponding dimension of a respective stud bay 130 into
which it will be fitted. Each insulating element 180 is gently urged into respective stud bay 130,
until second major face 188 of insulating element 180 touches building wrap 127 (if used) or is
level with first major framing surface 112. Care should be taken that there are no gaps between
each framing member 120 and a corresponding accommodated insulating element 180.
Thickness 186 of insulating element 180 is less than framing section thickness 116 thereby
forming cavity space 190 between first major face 187 of insulating element 180 and second
major framing section surface 114 for each wall section. At least one service supply line 192 is
then installed into cavity space 190, without disturbing or damaging insulating element 180,
penetrating through framing members 120 where required.
In this example, each cavity space 190 requires a minimum thickness of 25mm to allow for
installation of at least one service supply line 192, preferably the cavity space thickness is
approximately 30mm to allow for the installation of up to a 25mm service supply line. Once service
supply line 192 is installed, further cladding element 170 is installed by fixing to second major
framing section surface 114. Cut-outs may be made in further cladding element 170 to
accommodate inlet/outlet ports 194 for each service supply line 192 installed. These cut-outs
may be finished by installing aesthetic or functional finishing plates 174, trim and the like such as
skirting 172, switch plates, taps, drainage ports, and the like, to suit each service installed. Further
cladding element 170 may be finished by optionally applying a decorative surface treatment, such
as a paint coating or wallpaper or the like to suit the owner/resident's taste.

                                                   16
Figure 3 shows an example of an improved insulated wall section 100 in a dwelling construction,
and includes partial expanded views of (a) finishing plate 174 in position on cladding 170 to
provide a functional and aesthetic finish to (in this case) electrical inlet/outlet port 174 in the upper
expanded view panel, and (b) both service supply line 192 providing water supply with outlet 194
and service supply line 192 providing electricity supply with electrical inlet/outlet port 174 in the
lower expanded view section.
In another construction method, an improved insulated building section is constructed for use as
a flooring section (not shown).
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.
