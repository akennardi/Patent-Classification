                                      DESCRIPTION
       Title of Invention: TAPE CASSETTE AND TAPE PRINTER
[0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application
       No. 2015243050, which is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application
       No. 2010231425, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
       Technical Field
[0002]   The present invention relates to a tape cassette that is removably installed in a tape
       printer and a tape printer that is configured to removably house a tape cassette therein
       and that performs printing on a tape included in the tape cassette.
       Background Art
[0003] Conventionally, when a box-shaped tape cassette is installed in a cassette housing
       portion of a tape printer, the tape cassette is vertically inserted such that the plane
       surfaces (that is, the top and bottom surfaces) of the tape cassette match the
       upwardly-opening cassette housing portion. More specifically, when a user vertically
       installs the box-shaped tape cassette having side surfaces with a certain height in the
       cassette housing portion, the user sandwiches the side surfaces with his or her fingers
       and maintains the plane surfaces substantially horizontal.

            30, espctively Thus, the tape cassette 30 can be guided to a proper position in the
            cassette housing portion 8 The installaton/remowai modes of the tape cassette 30 with
             respect to the cassette housing portion 8 will, be described below in detail

             portion 8, the tape drive shaft 100 is fitted in the tape feed roller 46 by insertion, and
             the ribbon take-up shaft 95 is fitted in the ribbon take-up spool 44 by insertion. Then,
             when the cassette cover 6 is closed, the platen holder 12 moves toward the print
             position, so that the platen roller 15 opposes the thermal head 10, and the movable feed

        roller 14 Presses the tape feed roller 46 Thus, the tape printer I isin a state in which
        printing can be perfonned on the print medium,

        position, te switch portion 20 provided in the platen holder 12 opposes the aim
        indicator portion 80 provided in the tape cassete 30. At this time, if the tape cassette
        30 is installed at the proper position of the cassette housing portion 8, each of the
        detecting switches 2.1 enters an ON state or an OFF state, depending on a pattern of the
         indicators the non-pressing portion 81 and the pressing portion 82) included in the
         arrm indicator portion 80. More specifically, the detecting switch 21 that opposes the
         non-pressing portion 81 is inserted in the non-pressing portion 81 to enter the OFF
         state, The detecting switch 21 that. opposes the pressig portion 82 is pressed by the
         pressing portion 82 to enter the ON state,
 010i]       In the tape printer 1, the information on the tape cassette 30 is obtained based on a
         combination ot the ON and OFF states of the detecting switches 21. 'The tape cassette
         30 according to the fint embodiment is a general purpose cassette that can be
         assembled as various types, but is actually assembled as a thermal type tape cassette

;01 021       In the first embodiment, while printing is being performed in the tape printer 1, the
                                                                                              the heat

          spool 40 passes the fight side of the ribbon support hole 68 to be fed along
           path within the arm portion 34, Further, the heat-ensitive paper tape 55 is supplied
           from the exit 34A of the arm portion 34 to the head insertion portion 39 to be fed
           between the theral head 10 and the platen roller 15. Then. characters axe printed onto
           the print surface of the heat-sensiive paper tape 55 by the thermal head 10, Folowing
           that, the primed heat-sensitive paper tape 55 is further fed toward the tape discharge

 101031        While the printing is being performed, the ribbon take-up spool 44 is also driven
            rotate via the ribbon take-up shaft 95. However, the tape cassette 30 accordmg to the
            first embodiment does not include a ribbon spool in the cassette case 31 i that
            reason, the ribbon take-up spool 44 does not pull out the unused ink ribbon, nor does it
             take up the used ink ribbon. In other words, even when the terminal type tape cassette
             30 is used in the tape printer 1 that is equipped with the ribbon take-up shaft 95, the
            rotation anve of ie ribbon take-up shaft 95 does not have an influence on the printing

         operation onto the heat-sensitive paper tape 55 and printing can be correctly
         perforncd. In the above tape cassene 30, the ribbon take-up spool 44 my- not be

[0104]      The installation/renmoval modes of the tape cassette 30 with respect to the cassette
         housing portion 8 according to the fIrst embodiment will be described with reference to
         FIGS, 14 to 18, in FIGS. 14 to 16 that show the right side surface of the tape cassette
         30, only the holes associated with the installation and removal of the tape cassette 30
         are illustrated in a two-dot chain line for ease of understanding. in addition, in FIGS,
          14 to 16 that also show the schematic section views of the cassette housing portion 8 as
         seen from the right side thereof, only the shafts associated with the installation and
         removal of the tape cassete 30 are illustrated for ease of understanding. In FIG. 16,
         only the guide hole 47 and its vicinity are shown in a section as seen from the tight
          sie of the tape cassette 30,
 [01051      The relationships in the vertical direction among the respective members standing
          upward in the cassette housing portion S will be explained. In the first ernbodinent, the
          head holder 74, the tape drive shaft 100, the ribbon take-up shaft 95, the auxiliary shaft
          110 and the guide shaft 120 each have a height (lengths in the vertical direction) at
          least larger than the height T of the common portion 32. Three guide shafts (the tape
          drive shaft 100, the auxiliary shaft 110 and the guide shaft 120) among the shafts have
          a substanially sane height. In addition, the height of each of the tape drive shaft 100,
          the auxiliary shaft 110 and the guide shaft 120 is longer than the height of the ribbon
          take-up shaft 95 and the height of the head holder 74,
   O1061     For that reason, in a state in which the head holder 74, the tape drive shaft 100. the
           ribbon take-up shaft 95 and the auxiliary shaft 110 arc standing upward, with reference
           to the height position oni the planar portion of the cavity SA, the height positions of the
           upper ends of the tape drive shaft 100 and the auxiliary shaft 110 are the highest. The
           hight position of the upper end of the head holder 74 is the second highest, The height
           position of the upper end of the ribbon take-up shaft 95 is the lowest, The height
                                                                                                 as the
           position of the upper end of the ribbon take-up shaft 95 is substantially the same
           height position of the upper end of the themmal head 10 fixed to the head holder 74,
  [0107]      The. guide shaft 120 is standing upward on the cassette support portion SB positioned
           above the cavity SA, as described above. The upper end of the guide shaft 120 is at a
           height position higher than the. upper end of any of the head holder 74, the tape drive
            shaft J00, the ribbon take-up shaft 95 and the auxiliary shaft 110 The height (the
            length in the vertical di rection) froni each upper end of the tape drive shaft 100 and the
            auxiliary shaft 110 to the upper end of the guide shaft 120 is substantially equal to the
            height (the length in the vertical director) from the lower surface of the bottom wal

          36 of the tape cassette 30 to the lower surface of the co mon portion 32. In other
          words, the thickness of the tape cassette 30 is made smaller due to the common portion
          32 formed like steps, and thus the guide shaft 120 coresponditly extends above the
          height positions of the tape drive shaf 100 and the auxiliary shaft I10,
{0 0i8       As shown in FIG. 14, when the user instalIs the tape cassette 30 in the cassette
          housing portion 8. the user positions the tape cassette 30 such that the relative positions
          in a plan view of the roller support hole 64the first tape support hole 65 and the guide
          hole 47 substantially match those of the tape drive shaft 100, the auxiliary shaft 110
          and the auide shaft 120, respectively, Then the user vertically inserts the tape cassette
          30 n the cassette housing portion 8. while maintaining the top wall 35 and the botom
          wall 36 substantially horizontal as described above. As the tape cassette 30 is moved
          down toward the cassette housing portion 8, as shown in FRG J-5, the respective upper
                                                                                                  enter

           respectively. On the other hand, since the respective upper ends of the head holder
           and the ribbon take-up shaft 95 are positioned below the bottom wall 36, the head

             For that reason, even when the roller support hole 64, the first tape support

             shaft 100 is shahtlv smaller than the opening width of the tape feed roller 46 (the
             hole 46D) Therefoaw, even if the horizonal position of the tane feed roller 46 is
                                                                                        n     on or the
              sghtly changed within the roller support hole 64 due to vibration,

          like, the tape drive shaft 100 can be smoothly inserted therein.
[0 11]        Further, as described above, the opening width of the guide hole 47 is larger than the
          diameter of the leading end of the guide shaft 120 (the smail-diameter shaft portion
           120B described above) and parneuiarly the opening width in the left-right direction
          thereof is larger than the opening width in the front-rear direction. Thus, when the tape
          cassette 30 is installed, the guide shaft 120 can De inserted in the guide hole 47 even if
           the relative position of the guide hole 47 with respect to the guide shaft 120 is slightly
          offset n the left-right direction in a plan view.
 01121         With above-described configuration, the holes (the roller support hole 64, the first
           tape support hole 65, and the guide hole 47) of the tape cassette 30 do not need to be
           accurately positioned corresponding to the three guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100,
           the auxiliary shaft 110, and the guide shaft 120) provided in the cassette housing
           portion 8, Therefore, the user's load can be reduced at the installation of the tape
           cassette 30. A high-level dimensional accuracy may be required for a worker in order
           to completely match the dimensional widths of the roller support hole 64 and the guide
           hole 47 with the dimrensional widths of the tape drive shaft 10 and the guide shaft 120
            when the tape cassette 30 is manufactured. In that respect, by giving looseness in the
            left-right direction in the guide hole 47, a slight error of the dimensional accuracy in
            forrning the guide hole 47 may be acceptable, Therefore, the worker's load at the time
            of manufacturing the tape cassette 30 can be also reduced.
                                                                                           the thermal

            head ] 0 is inserted in the head insertion portion 39 from below, and the ribbon take-up
             shaft 95 is inserted in the shaft hole 44C via the opening 6713 from below. As
                                                                                                   the
             described above, since looseness is given in the head insertion portion 39 even if
             nead holder 74 is installed therein, the head holder 74 enters the loosely inserted state
             in which the head holder 74 can be displaced within the head insertion portion 39 in
             the front-rear direction and the left-right direction. In addition, since the opening width
             of the ribbon take-up spool 44 (the shaft hole 44C) is larger than the diameter of the
             ribbon take-up shaft 95, the ribbon take-up shaft 95 enters the loosely inserted state in
             which the ribbon take-up shaft 95 can displace within the ribbon take-tip spool 44 in
              the circumferential direction.

              drive shaft 100, the auxiliary shaft 110 and the guide shaft 120, the positioning pin 103
              standing upward on the cassette support portion 8B contacts the lower surface of the

[01 81      When the tape cassette 30 is removed from the cassette housing portion 8, the user'
         may pull out the tape cassette 30 upward from the cassette housing portion S with the
         fingers sandwiching the side wall 37 at both the right and left sides, Also at this time,
         the tape cassette 30 is guided in the upward direction by the three guide shafts (the tape
         drive shaft 100, the auxiliary shaft 110 and the guide shaft 120). Thus, the tape cassette
         30 may be less likely to be inclined and caught at an internal wall and the like of the
         cassette housing portion 8 while the tape cassette 30 is removed from the cassette
         housing portion 8.
 01 91       The tape cassene 30 according to the first embodiment has a weight distribution such
          that the first housing area 30C may be inclined downward. Therefore, the first housing
          area 30C is provided with the first tape support hole 65 that passes through the center
          of gravity of the first tape (the heat-sensitive paper tape 55), and the tape printer I is
          provided with the auxiliary shaft i110 to be inserted in the frst tape support hole 65.
          When the tape cassette 30 is installed or removed, the first housing aea 30C, which
          may cause a raised or inclined state of the tape cassette 30 inside the cassette housing

           of the first tape (specifically, the first tape support hole 65) in a plan view. For that
           reason, a positional displacement or an inclination may be appropriately prevented

  [O1 24[       in the first embodiment, the general purpose cassette assembled as the thermal type

         tape cassette 30 is used in the general purpose tape printer 1. Thus, a single tape printer
          I can be used with various types of the tape cassette 30 such as the thermal type, the
           eceptor type and the laminated type. In other words, it may not be necessary to use the
         different tape printer for each type. Furthermore, when the tape cassete is manu
         factured, the cassette case is normally formed by injecting plastic into a plurality of
         combined dies. In the case of the tape cassettes that corresporid to the same tape width,
         common dies can be used except for the die including the portion that forms the arm
          indicator portion 80. Thus, costs may be significantly reduced. When a thermal type
          tape cassette is assembled considering the above advantages, it may be effective that
          the long heat-sensitive paper tape 55 is wound on the first tape spool 40 and housed in
          the general purpose cassette case, as in the first erndodiment.
['1251        in the first ernbodirnent, the thermal type tape cassette 30 formed from a general

          tape cassete for the them al type may be conigued, or the tape cassete 30 of the first
          embodiment may be used in a dedicated tape printer for the thermal type.

           type may be configured.. An ink ribbon is not used for printing on die print medium
           with the thermal type. Therefore, if the tape printer I is a dedicated device in which
           only the thermal type tape cassette 30 is used, the tape printer .1may not include the
           ribbon take-up shaft 95 for rotating the ribbon take-up spool 44. For that reason, the

             The tape printer I and the tape c assette 30 according to a second embodiment will be
         explained with reference o FIGS. 24 to 31, The second embodiment describes an
         example in which the tape cassette 30 homes one tape (specifically, a non'
         hes-sensiive print tape as a print medium) and an ink ribbon, and has two guide holes
         for guiding the tape cassette 30 when the tape cassete 30 is installed in or removed
         from the tape printer 1..The second embodiment also describes an example in which
         the tape printer i has two guide snafts for guiding the tape cassette 30 to a proper
          position coresponding to the two guide holes described above.
[0 35]       As shown in I(iS. 24 to 26 the tape printer I according to the second embodiment
          is a general purpose device that can commonly use a plurality of types of tape cassettes
          30 with various tape type's, similar to the tape printer 1 according to die nirst em>
          bodiment (refer to FIGS I to 7). HIowever, the tape printer I according to the second
          embodiment is different from the tape printer I according to the first enbodi ment in
           that the auxiliary shaft 110 is not provided.
 [01361       As shown i FIG. 24, the tape cassete 30 according to the second embodiment is a
          general purpose cassette that may be assembled as various types, sit tar to the tape
          cassette 30 according to the first embodiment (refer to FIGS, 3 and 7 to 13) As shown
           in FIG 26, in the tape cassette 30 according to the second embodiment, the first tape
           spool 40 is rotatably supported by the first tape support hole 65. A non-heat-sensitrye
           print tape 57 as the first tape is wound on the first tape spool 40. In addition, a ribbon
           spool42 is rotatably supported by the ribbon support hole 68 and an ink ribbon 60 to
           be used for printing on the print tape 57 is wound on the ribbon spool 42 In other
           words, the niape cassette 30 according to the second embodiment is assembled as a so
           called receptor type tape cassette. The receptor type tape cassette 30 does not need to
           house other print medium, and thus does not include, the second tarse spool on which
            the second tape is wound.

            performed in the tape printer, the tape feed roller 46 that is driven to rtate va the
            tape drive shaft 100 pulis out the print tape 57 from the first tape spool 40 in concert
            with the movable feed roller 14, Further, the ribbon take-up spool 44, which is driven
            to rotate via the ribbon take-up shaft 95, pulls out an unused ink ribbon 60 from the

         ribbon spool 42 in synchronization with the print speed.

          head 10. Thereafter, the used ink ribbon 60 is peeled off from the printed print tape 57
          at the guide wail 38 and is taken up on the ribbon take-up spool 44. On the other hand,
          the printed pint tape 57 is further fed toward the tape discharge aperture 49,

            second embodiment, the weights of the first housing area 30C and the second housing
            area 30D defined by the division line K are close to each other. A user may vertically
             insert the tape cassete 30 having such a weight distribution in the cassette homsing
             portion 8, while maintaining the top wall 35 and the bottom wall 36 substantially

        positions the tape cassette 30 such that the relative positions in a plan view of the roller
        sport hole 64 and the guide hole 47 substantially match those of the tape drive shaft
         100 and the guide shaft 12', respectively. Then, the user vertically inserts the tape
        cassette 30 in the cassette housing portion 8 while mantaining the top wall 35 and the
        bottom wall 36 substantially horizonta, as described above. When the tape cassette 30

           portion 8 by the two guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120).
           Then. the tape cassette 30 is positioned at a proper horizontal position by the guide
           shaft 120 and the positioning pin 102, and is positioned at a proper height position by
           the positoning pims 102 and 103. Also when the tape cassette 30 is removed from the

           major axis and the minor axis) of the guide hole 47 are both larger than the diameter

          the smal- diameter shaft portion 120B of the guide shaft 120. The opening width ofthe
          guide hole 47 in the 'eft-right direction is larger than tbe opening widh in the fron
          rear direction. Since a length of the minor nixs of the guide hole. 47 is substantially
          equal to the diameter of the large diameter shaft portion 120A of the guide shaft 120,
          the guide shaft 120 is inserted in the guide hole 47 to be tightly engaged with the large
          diameter shaft portion 12tA in tne front-rear direction while looseness is allowed in
           the let right dimetion of the large-diameter shaft portion 120A, Thus, similar to the
           first embodiment the corresponding holes (the roller hole 64and the guide. hole 47) of
           the tape cassette 30 do not need to be accurately positioned with respect to all the two

           cassette 30. Further, the tape cassette 30 can be smoothly installed and removed while
           maintaining the print quality.
[01461         The tape cassette 30 according to the second embodiment has a weight distributing
            such that the weights of the first housing area 30C and the second housing area 30 D
            are close to each- other, For that reason. an inclination due to the own weight of the

               the center of gravity of the tape cassette 30 is positioned on or in the vicinity of
               division line K, the tape cassette 30 may be prevented from inclining with the division
               line K as the center of rotation.

  60])    The installation'removal modes of the tape cassette 30 with respect to the cassette
       housing portion 8 according to the third embodiment are similar to those in the second
       embodiment (refer to FIGS. 27 and 28). Specifically, the tape cassette 30 is guided to a
       proper position in the cassette housing portion 8 by the two guide shafts (the tape drive
       shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120). Also when the tape cassette 30 is removed from the
       cassette housing portion 8, the tape cassette 30 is guided upward along the two guide
       shafts.
  61       The guide hole 47 according to the third embodiment has a circular opening in a plan
       view, and its opening width is larger than tne diameter of the small-diameter shaft
       portion 120B of the guide shaft 120. For that reason, similar to the first embodiment,
       the corresponding holes (the roller support hole 64 and the guide hole 47) of the tape
       cassette 30 do not need to be accurately positioned with respect to aH the two guide
       shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120) provided in the cassette
       housing portion 8. Therefore, the user's load may be reduced at (he installation of the
        tape cassette 30. The diameter of the guide hole 47 according to the third embodiment
        is substantially equal to the diameter of the large-iameter shaft portion 120A of the
        guide shaft 120, For that reason, when the guide shaft 120 is inserted in the guide hole
        47, the large-diamneter shaft portion 120A is tightly engaged in all the circumferentiid
        directions of the guide hole 47. Therefore, the tape cassette 30 installed in the cassette
        housing portion 8 may be more accurately positioned at a proper horizomai position.
01621       The tape cassette 30 according to the third embodiment has a weight distribution
        such that the center of aravity of the tape cassette 30 is on or inthe vicinity of the
        division line K.in a plan view. For that reason, an inclination due to the own weight of
         the tape cassette 30 may be less likely to occur in the process of the installation of the
         tape cassette 30 in the cassette housing portion 8, Thus. even when the auxiliary shaft
          110 is not provided unlike the first embodiment, the tape cassette 30 may be guided to
         the proper position in the cassette housing portion 8 by the two guide shafts (the tape
         dr-ive shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120).
[O 3        Further, the tape cassette 30 is guided in the vertical direction at the two points, that
         is, a pair of corner portions on a diagonal of the tape cassette 30 (specifically, the roller
          support hole 64 and the guide hole 47) in a plan view. In other words, the tape cassette
          30 is guided in the installation/removal direction about the division line K.that passes
          through or in the vicinity of the center of gravity of the heat-sensitive paper tape 55.
          For that reason, a positional displacement or an inclination may be appropriately
          prevented when the tape cassette 30 is installed in the cassette housing portion
[0164]      In the third embodiment, the thermal type tape cassette 30 fmined from a general
          purple cassette is used in the genera purpose tape printer 1, Hhowever, a dedicated
          tape cassette for the thermaletype may be con-ngured, or the tape cassette 30 of the third

           embodiment may be us ed in a dedicated tape printer for the thermal type
[01651        For example, as shown in FIGS 19 and 34, a tape printer 1 dedicated for the thermal
            ype moay be configurd. An ink ribbon is not used for printing on the print medium
           with the thermal type Therefore, as described above with reference to FIG. 19. the
           tape printer I dedicated for the thermal type does not include the ribbon take -up shaft
           95, Further, the tampe printer i shown in FIG, 34 does not include the auxiliary shaft
           110 unlike the tape printer I shown in FIG. 19 (refer to FIG, 34).
 101661        As shown in FIGS, 33 and 34, a dedicated tape cassette 30 for the thermal type
           capable of housing only the heat-sensitive paper tape may be configured. Unlike the
           tape cassette 30 dedicated for the thermal type shown in FIGS, 20 and 21, the tape
           cassette 30 dedicated for the thermal type shown in FIGS. 33 and 34 is configured to
           house the heat-sensitive paper tape 55 on the division line K For that reason, the tape
           cassette 30 shown in FIGS. 33 and 34 has none of the first tape spool and the first tape
           suppon hole 65 for supporting the first tape spool, the ribbon take-up spool 44 and the
            take-up spool support hole 67 for supporting the ribbon take-up spool 44, and the
            ri bbon spool and the ribbon support hole 68 for supporting the ribbon spool
 101671        Also with such a configuration, the tape cassete 30 may be installed in and removed
            from the tape printer I in a similar manner as above, In other words, as shown in FIG.
                                                                                             are inserted
            35, the two guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120)
             in the two corresponding guide holes (the roller support hole 64 and the guide hole 47
             respectively, so that the tape cassette 30 is guided to the proper portion in the cassette
            housing portion S.

         smoothly installed and removed while maintaining the print quality.
[01811       The tape cassette 30 according to the fourth embodiment has a weight distribution
          such that the weights of the first housing area 30C and the second housing area 30D
          are close to each other, and the center of gravi ty of the tape cassette 30 is positioned on
          or in the vicinity of the division line K in a plan view. For that reason, an inclination
          due to the own weight of the tape cassette 30 may be less likely to occ.r in the process
          of the installation of the tape cassette 30 in the cassette housing portion 8. Thus, even
          when the auxiliary shaft 110 is not provided, unlike the first embodiment, the tape
          cassette 30 rnay be guided to the proper position of the cassette housing portion 8 by
          the two guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and the guide shaft 120).
 {0182J      Further, the tape cassette 30 is guided in the vertical direction at two points, that is, a
           pair of corner portions (specifically, tie roller support hole 64 and the guide hole 47)
           on the diagonal of the tape cassette 30 in a plan view. In other words, the tape cassette
           30 is guided in the instailation/removal direction about the division line K that passes
           between the center of gravity of the double-sided adhesive tape 58 and the center of
           gravity of the ink ribbon 60 and that passes through or in the vicinity of the center of
            gravity of the film tape 59. For that reason, a positional displacement or an inclination
           may be appropriately prevented when the tape cassette 30 is installed in the casseue
           housing portion 8,
   0183]      in the fourth embodiment, the laminated type tape cassette 30 formed from a general
           purpose cassette is used in the tape printer I including the two guide shafts. However,
           the tape cassette 30 according to the fourth embodiment may be installed in the tape
           printer I including the three guide shafts according to the first embodiment, for
           example. In this case, similar to the first embodiment, the three guide shafts (the tape
           drive shaft 100, the auxiliary shaft 110 and the guide shaft 120) are inserted in the
            three corresponding guide holes (the roller support hole 64, the first tape support hole
            65 and the guide hole 47), respectively., so that the tape cassette 30 is guided to the

             support hole 64, the guide hole 47 and the first tape support hole 65) at the same time,
             respectively, depending on the thickness (the length in the vertical direction) of the
             tape cassette 30
  [0195]       Further, the guide shaft 120 nay extend to a higher posion (for example, the leagtn
             of the guide shaft 120 may be made larger corresponding to the tape cassette 30

        having a larger tape width (such as 48 mm), However, the length of the guide shaft 120
        may be restricted depending on the shape or size of the tape printer 1 (particularly, the
        cassette housing portion 8). Tn such a case, when the tape cassette 30 is installed in the
          cassette housing portion 8, at first, the yo guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and
        the auxiliary shaft 110) may be inserted in the two guide holes (die roller support hole
        64 and the first tape support hole 6       T)hen, the third guide shaft (the guide shaft 120)
        may be inserted in the third guide hole (he guide hole 47) while the tape cassette 30 is
        being guided by the two guide shafts and moved down. According to this installation
        mode, before the guide shaft 120 is inserted in the guide hole 47, the head holder '74
        and the ribbon take-up shaft 95 may be inserted in the head insertion portion 39 and the
         ake- up spool support hole 67, respectively,
[0 961     As described above, the head insertion portion 39 and the take-p spool support hole
         67 each have an opening widi through which the head holder 74 and the ribbon take
         up shaft 95 are loosely inserted, respectively. For that reason. a failure in which ithe
         head holder 4 or the ribbon take-up shaft 95 contacts other members to hinder the n
         staliation of the tape cassette 30 may be prevented in the process of the installation of
         the tap cassette 30. Furthermore, even if a positional displacement or an inclination
         occurs when the head holder 74 is insated in the head insertion portion 39 while the
         tape cassette 30 is being guided by the two guide shafts, when the guide
                                                                                        shaft 120 is
         inserted in the guide hole 47, the head holder 74 is corrected to a proper installation
         state, This allso applies to the take-up spool support hole 67 and the ribbon take-up
         shaft 95. 'Thus, even when the upper end position of the guide shaft 120 is restricted,
         the tape cassette 30 may be guided to and positioned at a proper position in the cassette
         housing portion 8.
 1C1971     Moreover, even when the tape drive shaft 1(X) and the auxiliary shaft 110 are equal to
         or lower than the head holder 74 and the ribbon ake-up shaft 95 and the guide shaft
          120 does not enter the guide hole 47 at the start of the installation of the tape cassette

[0211       'The unide hole 47 shown in FIG, 45 is an ellipse-shaped hole similar to the guide
         hole 47 in the second embodiment (refer to FIG 24 and the like). However, the gide
         hole 47 shown in FIG. 45 is different in that the guide hole 47 has the major axis along
         the division line K and the mincr axis along a direction perpendicular to the division

           cylirical wall portion 85 that extends through the shaft hole 40D of the first tape
           spool 40, and the auxiliary shaft 10 that is inserted in and removed front the first tape
           support hole 65 is also inserted in and removed from the shaft hole 40D at the in
            stallation and remova-l of the tape cassette 30. However, as shown in FIG. 56, in place
            of the cylindrical wail portion 85, the first tape support hole 65 may be provided with a

            toward each other.
  [0223]       In this case, the first tape spool 40 may have asingle-wall cordigura      in which the
            heatsensitive paper tape 55 is wound on the spool main body 40E that is a cyliuder

         member having substantially the same height as the tape width of the print medium
         similarr to the print tape 57 and the film tape 59). The pair of short cylinders 88 is
         inserted in the openings at both ends of the spool main body 40E within the cassette
         case 31, Even with such a configuration the first tape spool 40 may be rotatablv

[0224]       The opening 65B of the first tape support hole 65 may be disposed to face the shaft
         hole 40D such that the auxiliary shaft 110 can be inserted in and removed from the
         shaft hole 40D of the first rape spool 40 when the tape printer I has the auxiliary shaft
          110, In other words, the opening 65B provided in the bottom wall 36 and the shaft hole
         40D may be connected. In the first embodiment shown in FIG. 10, the opening 65B
          through which the auxiliary shaft 110is inerted and removed is indirectly connected
          with the shaft hole 40D via the cylindrical wal portion 85, and the shaft hole 65C of

            heat-sensitive paper tape 55, the print tape 57, the double-sided adhesive tape 58 the
            film tape 59 and the ink ribbon 60) are wound on the spools (specifically, the first tape
            spool 40, the second tape spool 41 and the ribbon spool 42 respect vely.owever the
            tapes and the ink ribbon may not be wound on spools. For example, a tape or an ink

       ribbon may be wound so as to form a hole about the center of winding without the
       spools to be configured as a so-called, coreless type.
[0228]   In the first to fourth embodiments, examples in which the two guide holes (the roller
       support hole 64 and the guide hole 47) provided in the tape cassette 30 are used so that
       the tape cassette 30 is guided along the two guide shafts (the tape drive shaft 100 and
       the guide shaft 120) to be installed in the cassette housing portion 8. However, a
       member that is inserted in the guide holes of the tape cassette 30 is not limited to the
       guide shafts provided in the tape printer 1.
[0229]   For example, as shown in FIG. 57, a pair of shafts 140 corresponding to the roller
       support hole 64 and the guide hole 47 may be provided in advance to stand upward at a
       position where the tape cassette 30 is to be exhibited. Each of the shafts 140 has a shaft
       140A and a base 140B. The shaft 140A has a diameter that can be inserted in and
       removed from the roller support hole 64 and the guide hole 47. The base 140B has a
       predetermined height, and the shafts 140A are standing upward form the upper surface
       of the base 140B. When the tape cassette 30 is exhibited, the user may insert the shafts
       140A in the roller support hole 64 and the guide hole 47, respectively. Then, as the
       tape cassette 30 is moved down along the shafts 140A, the tape cassette 30 is
       eventually placed on the base 140B positioned at the lower end of the shafts 140A.
       Thus, the tape cassette 30 may be held by the pair of shafts 140 at a predetermined
       height position where it can be visually seen with ease.
[0230]   If the position of the upper ends of the shafts 140 shown in FIG. 57 may be made
       higher (for example, the length of each shaft 140A is made larger), a plurality of tape
       cassettes 30 may be sequentially stacked on the base 140B along the shafts 140A. Thus,
       the plurality of tape cassettes 30 can be collectively stored, collected, carried and the
       like. In addition, if one tape cassette 30 is positioned at the upper ends of the shafts
       140, the tape cassette 30 can be exhibited at a height position where it can be visually
       seen with more ease. The usage can be employed by using a set (three) of shafts 140
       for the tape cassette 30 provided with the three guide holes (the roller support hole 64,
       the guide hole 47 and the first tape support hole 65).
