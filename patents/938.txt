ABSTRACT
A bed base formed from two panels each of which is moulded from a plastics
material. Each panel has a frame which bounds and supports a planar grid structure.
The panels abut each other with the respective grid structures coplanar and are
supported above ground level by a number of legs which, additionally, keep the
panels secured to each other.

                                       BED BASE
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001] This invention relates to a base for a bed.
[0002] An object of the present invention is to provide a bed base which, at least in a
preferred embodiment, can be mass-produced, is of relatively low weight, and can be
stored and transported in a compact form, and which lends itself to easy assembly.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] The invention provides, in the first instance, a panel for use in a bed base
which includes a rectangular frame, a substantially planar grid structure which is
peripherally bounded by the frame and which has a first side and a second side and
respective securing formations located at least at corners of the rectangular frame,
and wherein the rectangular frame includes at least three spaced apart elongate ribs
which extend from the first side to the second side.
[0004] Two of the ribs may be at a right angle to the planar grid structure, and two of
the ribs may diverge apart, moving from the first side to the second side.
[0005] The invention further extends to a bed base which includes at least two
panels, each panel being of the aforementioned kind, the panels being positioned
with opposed edges abutting each other and with the grid structures in a coplanar
configuration, and a plurality of legs which include respective fixing formations which
are engaged with the respective securing formations.
[0006] The grid structure in the panel may comprise a plurality of elements which
define mesh apertures arranged in a regular array.       Each mesh aperture may be

substantially square or rectangular and may be bounded by elements which are
oriented to ensure that each element displays maximum rigidity or load-bearing
capability.
[0007] The panel is preferably moulded from a plastics material.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0008] The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the
accompanying drawings in which:
Figure 1 is a plan view of a panel used in a bed base according to the invention;
Figure 2 shows details of a frame of the panel on an enlarged scale;
Figure 3 is a side view of the panel of Figure 1; and
Figure 4 is a perspective view from above of an assembled bed base according to
the invention.
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0009] Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is a plan view from below of a panel
10 which is used in a bed base 12 according to the invention. Figure 2 shows the
panel 10 in cross-section and on an enlarged scale taken on a line 2-2 in Figure 1.
[0010] The panel 10 includes a substantially rectangular frame 14 which has
opposed short edges 16A and 16B respectively, and opposed longer edges 18A and
18B respectively. The edges 16A and 18A intersect at a rounded corner 20. The
edges 16B and 18A intersect at a rounded corner 22.          The edges16A and 16B
intersect the edge 18B at corners 24 and 26, respectively, which are defined by
portions of the edges which are at a right angle to each other.

[0011] The frame 14 includes a strong, rigidifying, section 30 which is shown in
enlarged detail in Figure 2. A grid structure 36 is bounded by the frame 14. The
structure 36 includes a plurality of small, substantially square, apertures 38, each of
which is surrounded by walls 40 which are orientated so that, in use, a longer
dimension of the wall is vertical thereby to confer maximum rigidity and load-bearing
capability to the grid structure.
[0012] The panel, along a centre line 48, has a substantial rigidifying rib 50 and a
second rigidifying rib that is similar and transverse to the reinforcing rib 50.
[0013] An upper side 52 of the grid structure, see Figure 3, is planar. This, in use, is
a side which presents upwardly and which is used for supporting a mattress or
bedding.
[0014] The frame 14 has a rigid structure due to the inclusion of two peripheral ribs
54 and 56 which are at a right angle to the planar grid structure, and two ribs 58 and
60 which diverge from a node 62, from which the rib 56 projects, moving from a lower
side 64 of the grid structure to the upper side 52.
[0015] Figure 4 shows, in perspective, a corner leg 90 engaged with a corner of 92
of a panel.
[0016] The leg 90 has two spigot-like projections 94 (shown in dotted outline
disposed at a right angle to each other). An upper end of the leg is shaped to fit into
a downwardly facing socket 98 at the corner 92, and the projections 94 then clip into
complementary slots 100. The structure 96 is flanked by spigot-like projections 100.
Each projection is spaced from the curved structure 96 by a respective narrow slot
102.

[0017] The panels are assembled edge to edge to form a bed base. The panels are
fixed together using suitable fasteners. A corner leg 90 is then positioned at each
respective corner 92 of the panels.
[0018] As needed middle and intermediate legs are fixed to form two panels to
ensure the assembled bed base is adequately supported. A mattress and bedding,
not shown, are placed on upper sides 52 of the two panels.
[0019] The legs support the panels above ground level but, additionally, some of the
legs serve to maintain the adjacent panels in secure abutment with one another.
[0020] The components of the bed base are made from a suitable plastics material.
An integrated space-frame type of construction is adopted to ensure maximum
rigidity and strength with minimal material usage. The base is provided in a modular
form so that it can be stored and transported in a compact arrangement. Assembly
is readily effected and no tools are required. All components are interconnectable
with a fit and snap action.    The resulting product is rigid and provides adequate
support for a mattress or for bedding material.   If required, sheet material sections,
not shown, can be attached to outer faces of the legs thereby to enclose a volume
which is below the panels.
[0021] A significant feature is that each panel has a strong peripheral frame, as
shown in Figure 2, which enables the bed base to carry a significant weight, without
distortion.
