RELATED APPLICATIONS
[001]    The present application is a divisional of AU Patent Application No <removed-apn>,
which is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No 2014237417 filed on 10
March 2014, which is the National Phase Application derived from International (PCT)
Application PCT/US2014/022482, filed on 10 March 2014 which U.S. Provisional
Application Serial No. 61/792,896, filed 15 March 2013, entitled "Wireless lockset with
integrated antenna touch activation, and light communication method", the disclosures of all
of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[002]    This disclosure relates generally to electro-mechanical locks.
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
[003]    Electronic locks have gained increasing acceptance and widespread use in residential
and commercial markets. These locksets control ingress through doors in a building by
requiring certain electronic credentials. For example, these locksets typically include a
control circuit that determines whether to unlock the lockset based on credentials provided by
the user. In some cases, for example, the credentials and/or commands may be provided
wirelessly to the lockset, such as disclosed in Pre-Grant Publication No. US 2012/0234058 for
a "Wireless Access Control System and Related Methods," filed March 8, 2012, which is
hereby incorporated by reference.
[004]    In the access control and security industries, wireless locksets typically include an
antenna located on the interior side of the door, usually behind a plastic "RF window" to not

interfere with the RF propagation. Some locksets attempt to place an antenna on the exterior
side of the door, but must deal with the challenge of making the antenna aesthetically
appealing, RF communication efficient, tamper resistant, and easy to manufacture.
[005]     In this specification, where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or
discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of
knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date:
(i)     part of common general knowledge; or
(ii)    known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification
        is concerned.

[008]    In some embodiments it is further provided that the exterior assembly includes a
cylinder guard cover extending from the mechanical lock assembly, wherein the touch surface
comprises an external surface of the cylinder guard cover.
[009]    In some embodiments it is further provided that the touch surface comprises
substantially the entire external surface of the cylinder guard cover.
[0010]   In some embodiments it is further provided that the guard cover has a generally
frustoconical shape.
[0011]   In some embodiments it is further provided that the touch surface comprises
substantially an entire side wall of the cylinder guard cover.
[0012]   In some embodiments it is further provided that the exterior assembly includes a
handle with an external surface and wherein the touch surface includes at least a portion of the
external surface of the handle.
[0013]   In some embodiments it is further provided that the exterior assembly includes a rose
with an external surface and wherein the touch surface includes at least a portion of the
external surface of the rose.
[0014]   In some embodiments it is further provided that the mechanical locking assembly
includes an external surface and wherein the touch surface includes at least a portion of the
external surface of the mechanical locking assembly
[0015]   According to another aspect there is provided a lockset comprising: a locking device
moveable between a locked position and an unlocked position, wherein the locking device

includes one or more of cylinder guard cover, a handle, or a rose; a touch surface forced as
part of the lockset; an electrical circuit configured to identify touching of the touch surface;
and wherein the touch surface comprises an external surface of one or more of the cylinder
guard cover, the handle, or the rose of the locking device.
[0016]    In some embodiments it is further provided that there is an insulator separating the
touch surface and the electrical circuit.
[0017]    In some embodiments there is further included a conductive medium electrically
connecting the touch surface and the electrical circuit.
[0018]    In some embodiments it is further provided that the conductive medium comprises
one or more of a conductive wave washer, a conductive foam, a conductive tape or a
conductive grease.
[0019]    According to another aspect there is provided a lockset comprising: a locking device
moveable between a locked position and an unlocked position, wherein the locking device
includes a cylinder guard cover; a touch surface formed as part of the lockset; an electrical
circuit configured to identify touching of the touch surface; and wherein the touch surface

[0020]    In some embodiments it is further provided that there is an insulator separating the
touch surface of the cylinder guard cover and the electrical circuit.
[0021]    In some embodiments there is further included a conductive medium electrically
connecting the touch surface of the cylinder guard cover and the electrical circuit.
[0022]    According to another embodiment there is provided a wireless electromechanical
lock with one or more of an internal antenna, touch activation, and/or a light communication
device that acts as a user interface. Although this disclosure describes these features as
implemented on a deadbolt for purposes of example, these features are applicable to any type
of lockset, including but not limited to deadbolts, knobset locks, handleset locks, etc.

                                                V
[0023]    In one embodiment, the lock is made of mixed metals and plastic, with engineered
cavities to contain electronics and RF antennas. For example, in some embodiments, the lock
utilizes an antenna near the exterior face of the lockset, designed inside the metal body of the
lockset itself This is unique in that the metal body has been engineered to meet strict
physical security requirements and also allow the embedded front-facing antenna to propagate
RF energy efficiently. This holds many advantages over other means of antenna placement
including compact size, cleaner aesthetic appearance, simplistic manufacturing, and tamper
resistance.
[0024]    A light communication device is provided in some embodiments to communicate
information, visually, to the user via animations and dynamic displays of light. For example,
a light communication device could be formed in a ring-shape in some embodiments that is
incorporated into the exterior of the lock. In some cases, the light communication device can
be used to selectively illuminate regions to create animations of dynamic multi-color light and
configurations of static light along the circumference of the exterior light ring to communicate
multiple user messages. These animations allow mimicking of lock operation to be possible.
For example, animations may include, but are not limited to, sequentially illuminating light
segments to show the direction of bolt movement or slow animation of light to indicate the
lockset is busy, etc. Embodiments are contemplated in which the light communication device
could be formed in shapes other than circular for a ring, such as rectangular, square,
triangular, etc.
[0025]    In some cases, the lockset includes a touch activation capability, which can be used
to lock/unlock the lock and/or otherwise provide input. In some embodiments, for example,
the entire outside cover of the lock is touch sensitive and allows a user to touch the lock to
activate various functions of the lockset. This capability is unique because it does not require
any special keypad area, button press, or glass capacitive touch sensor area, but rather allows

the entire diameter of the lockset cover to act as a capacitive touch sensor for activation.
[0026]    In other embodiments, this disclosure provides a lockset with a latch assembly
including a bolt movable between an extended position and a retracted position. The lockset
has a controller configured to electronically control movement of the bolt between the
extended position and the retracted position. An interior assembly is provided that includes a
turn piece for manually actuating the bolt between the extended position and the retracted
position. The lockset has an exterior assembly including a mechanical lock assembly
configured to manually actuate the bolt between the extended position and the retracted
position. The exterior assembly includes a light communication device with a plurality of
independently controllable regions in electrical communication with the controller. In some
embodiments, the controller is configured to actuate multiple of the regions in a predefined
configuration to identify a condition of the lockset.
[0027]    Depending on the circumstances, the controller could be configured to actuate the
predefined configuration by adjusting (a) illumination of multiple regions of the light
communication device, (b) intensity of multiple regions of the light communication device,
and/or (c) color of multiple regions of the light communication device. In some
embodiments, the controller is configured to actuate the predefined configuration by
sequentially adjusting adjacent regions of the light communication device in illumination,
intensity, and/or color.
[0028]    In some embodiments, the light communication device includes at least three regions
that are configured to sequentially adjust in illumination, intensity, and/or color. For example,
the controller could be configured to sequentially adjust adjacent regions in a first order to
identify a first condition of the lockset. Likewise, the controller could be configured to
sequentially adjust adjacent regions in a second order, which is opposite of the first order, to
identify a second condition of the lockset. For example, the orders in which adjustments are

made could indicate the direction of the bolt.
[0029]    Embodiments are contemplated in which at least a portion of the regions of the light
communication device are arranged in a ring-like shape. In some cases, for example, the
controller could be configured to sequentially adjust adjacent regions in a generally clockwise
fashion to indicate movement of the bolt in a first direction. The movement of the bolt in the
opposition direction could be indicated with a counter-clockwise actuation of the regions. In
some embodiments, the exterior assembly includes a cylinder guard cover having a generally
frustoconical shape. In some cases, the light communication device is generally concentric to
a frustum of the cylinder guard cover.
[0030]    According to yet another embodiment, this disclosure provides a lockset with a latch
assembly including a bolt movable between an extended position and a retracted position. A
controller is provided to electronically control movement of the bolt between the extended
position and the retracted position. The lockset includes an interior assembly including a turn
piece for manually actuating the bolt between the extended position and the retracted position.
An exterior assembly is provided with a mechanical lock assembly configured to manually
actuate the bolt between the extended position and the retracted position. The exterior
assembly includes a touch surface.
[0031]    controller is configured to actuate movement of the bolt between the extended
position and the retracted position responsive to capacitive touch sensing of the touch surface.
[0032]    In some embodiments, the exterior assembly includes a cylinder guard cover
extending from the mechanical lock assembly and the touch surface comprises an external
surface of the cylinder guard cover. For example, in some cases the touch surface comprises
substantially the entire external surface of the cylinder guard cover. Embodiments are
contemplated in which the guard cover has a generally frustoconical shape. For example, the
touch surface could include substantially an entire side wall of the cylinder guard cover.

[0033]    According to still further embodiments, this disclosure provides a lockset with a
locking device moveable between a locked position and an unlocked position. The locking
device includes a cylinder guard cover, a handle, and/or a rose. A touch surface is formed as
part of the lockset. An electrical circuit is provided that is configured to identify touching of
the touch surface. In some embodiments, an insulator separates the touch surface and the
electrical circuit. A conductive medium could be provided that electrically connects the touch
surface and the electrical circuit.
[0034]    According to yet further embodiments, the disclosure provides a lockset with a latch
assembly including a bolt movable between an extended position and a retracted position.
The lockset includes a controller configured to electronically control movement of the bolt
between the extended position and the retracted position. An antenna is in electrical
communication with the controller. An interior assembly is provided that includes a turn
piece for manually actuating the bolt between the extended position and the retracted position.
An exterior assembly is also provided with a mechanical lock assembly with a cylinder
configured to manually actuate the bolt between the extended position and the retracted
position. The exterior assembly includes a cylinder guard surrounding the cylinder that is
configured to structurally protect the cylinder. The cylinder guard defines an internal cavity
in which the antenna is at least partially disposed. In some cases, the antenna is entirely
disposed in the internal cavity.
[0035]    In some embodiments, the cylinder guard has a front side and a rear side. The cavity
has an open end on the front side of the cylinder guard. A front cover extends from the open
end of the cavity that is generally coplanar with a front face of the cylinder. Typically, the
front cover is formed from a generally RF transparent material. In some cases, a light
communication device extends between the open end of the cavity and the front cover. In
some such situations, the light communication device is formed from a generally RF

                                                  IV
transparent material.
[0036]      Additional features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those
skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrated
embodiment exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.
It is intended that all such additional features and advantages be included within this
description and be within the scope of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0039]    While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications
and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of
example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood,
however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular

                                               I.)
forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents,
and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
[0040]    This disclosure generally relates to an electromechanical lock with certain features.
The term "electronic lock" is broadly intended to include any type of lockset that uses
electrical power in some manner, including but not limited to electronic deadbolts, electronic
lever sets, etc. This disclosure encompasses the integration of one or more of features
described herein into any type of electronic lock and is not intended to be limited to any
particular type of electronic lock.
[0041]    Figure 1 shows an example lock assembly 100 according to one embodiment of the
disclosure. In the example shown, the lock assembly 100 includes an exterior assembly 102,
a latch assembly 104, and an interior assembly 106. Typically, the exterior assembly 102 is
mounted on the outside of a door, while the interior assembly 106 is mounted inside a door.
The latch assembly 104 is typically mounted in a bore formed in the door. The term "outside"
is broadly used to mean an area outside a door and "inside" is also broadly used to denote an
area inside a door. With an exterior entry door, for example, the exterior assembly 102 may
be mounted outside a building, while the interior assembly 106 may be mounted inside a
building. With an interior door, the exterior assembly may be mounted inside a building, but
outside a room secured by the lock assembly 100; the interior assembly 106 may be mounted
inside the secured room. The lock assembly 100 is applicable to both interior and exterior
doors.
[0042]    In the example shown, the exterior assembly 102 is in the form of a deadbolt. As
discussed above, however, this disclosure is not intended to be limited to only an electronic
deadbolt, but encompasses any kind of electronic lock. As shown, the exterior assembly 102
includes a cylinder guard cover 108 that houses internal components of the exterior assembly
102. In the example shown, the cylinder guard cover 108 has a decorative shape with a rear

portion 110 that would be adjacent a door (not shown) and a front portion 112 extending from
the door. In this example, the cylinder guard cover 108 has a tapered shape from the rear
portion 110 to the front portion 112, but the exterior assembly 102 and cylinder guard 108
could have a wide variety of different sizes and shapes depending on the particular
circumstances.
[0043]    In the embodiment shown, the front portion 112 of the exterior assembly 102
includes a front cover 114 that surrounds a mechanical locking assembly 116. A mechanical
key (not shown) may be inserted into the mechanical lock assembly 116 to mechanically
unlock the lock assembly 100.
[0044]    In the embodiment shown, a light communication device 118 surrounds the front
cover 114. In this example, the light communication device 118 is formed in the shape of a
ring surrounding the front cover 114 and mechanical lock assembly 116. However, the light
communication device 118 could be formed in other shapes or positioned differently on the
exterior assembly 102.
[0045]    As explained further below, the light communication device 118 includes a plurality
of regions that could be independently controlled to visually communicate messages to the
user, including but not limited to an action currently being processed by the lock assembly
 100, information about the status of the lock assembly 100, and/or requests for user input. By
way of example, the light communication device 118 could visually communicate the
direction of bolt movement by illuminating regions in sequence to create a rotation animation
showing a direction of movement. The light communication device 118 could visually
communicate messages to the user by controlling various attributes of the regions, such as
turning regions on/off, changing intensity of regions, changing colors illuminated by regions,
or other manners of changing the illumination of the light communication device 118.
[0046]    In some embodiments, the lock assembly 100 may be touch activated. For example,

                                                I -J
the lock assembly 100 may use capacitive sensing to determine whether the user wants to
actuate the lock 100. The touch surface for capacitive sensing to actuate the lock assembly
 100 could be any external surface, including but not limited to a cylinder guard cover,
cylinder guard, keyway, handle, rose, or other exterior surface of the lock assembly 100. In
the example shown, the exterior assembly 102 uses capacitive sensing to determine when a
user touches the cylinder guard cover 108. Accordingly, in the embodiment shown, the user
is able to touch anywhere on the cylinder guard cover 108 to lock or unlock the lock assembly
 100, or otherwise activate various functions of the lock assembly 100.
[0047]    In the example shown, the exterior lock assembly 102 has a torque blade 120
extending from the rear portion 110. The torque blade extends through an adaptor 122 in the
embodiment shown, which is received within a bore in a door to which the lock assembly 100
is being installed or mounted.
[0048]    The latch assembly 104 is disposed in a core in a door and may be actuated manually
by the mechanical lock assembly 116, or electronically by touching anywhere on the cylinder
guard cover 108 (in the embodiment shown) to extend/retract a bolt 124. The bolt 124 moves
linearly in and out of a sleeve 126. When the bolt 124 is retracted, an end of the bolt 124 is
generally flush with a base plate 128. When the bolt 124 is extended, the bolt 124 protrudes
through an edge bore in the door into an opening 130 of a strike plate 132, which is positioned
in ajamb adjacent the door. As is typical, the strike plate 132 is attached to the jamb using
fasteners 134. Likewise, fasteners 136 attach the base plate 128 of the latch assembly 104 to a
door.
[0049]    In the embodiment shown, the latch assembly 104 includes a spindle 138 that is
drivable in a first direction to extend the bolt 124 and a second direction to retract the bolt
 124. The spindle 138 is configured to receive the torque blade 120 such that rotation of the
torque blade 120 in a first direction retracts the bolt 124; whereas, rotation of the torque blade

                                                 IU
 120 in the opposite direction causes the spindle to retract the bolt 124.
[0050]    The torque blade 120 extends through the latch assembly 104 into an opening 140 in
a mounting plate 142, which is attached to an interior side of a door. The torque blade 120
passes through the opening 140 and is received by a spindle driver 144. The spindle driver
 144 provides electronic control of the bolt 124, such as using a motor to rotate the spindle
driver 144 in either a first direction or in a second direction. Since the torque blade 120 is
disposed within the spindle 138, rotation of the spindle driver 144 may be used to extend
and/or retract the bolt 124 of the latch assembly 104. In the embodiment shown, fasteners
 146 extend through holes 148 in the mounting plate, which are aligned with openings 150 in
the latch assembly 104. A wiring harness (not shown) electrically connects electronics
between the exterior assembly 102 and the interior assembly 106.
[0051]    Figure 2 is a side cross-sectional view of the lock assembly 100 in an assembled
state. In the example shown, the torque blade 120 can be seen extending from a rear portion
 110 of the exterior assembly 102 through the spindle 138 of the latch assembly 104 into the
spindle driver 144 of the interior assembly 106. The torque blade 120 may be driven to
extend/retract the bolt 124 in several ways. For example, the mechanical lock assembly 116
could be actuated by a mechanical key to rotate the torque blade 120, which would allow the
bolt 124 to be moved extended/retracted. The exterior assembly 102 could be used to
electronically actuate the latch assembly 104 by touching anywhere on the cylinder guard
cover 108 (assuming the lock assembly 100 received authenticated credentials prior to the
user touching the cylinder guard cover 108). By touching anywhere on the exterior assembly
 102 to actuate the bolt 124, a message is sent from the exterior assembly 102 to the interior
assembly 106 using a wiring harness to actuate a motor in the interior assembly 106 that
drives the torque blade 120 using the spindle driver 144. Additionally, if the user is inside the
door, a turn piece 152 could be manually rotated by the user to actuate the torque blade 120

                                              I /
(via the spindle driver 144), thereby moving the bolt 124 between its extended and retracted
positions.
[0052]    Figure 3 is an exploded view of the exterior assembly 102. As shown, the
mechanical locking assembly 116, which could be a pin-tumbler locking arrangement, has a
torque blade 120 extending therefrom. As shown, the front end of the mechanical locking
assembly 116 is received by an opening 154 in the front cover 118. Preferably, the front
cover 118 is made of a RF transparent material, such as a plastic. By way of example only,
the front cover 118 could be made of a material called Terluran GP-22 by BASF of
Ludwigshafen, Germany or Polylac PA-727 by Chi Mei Corporation of Taiwan.
[0053]    In the embodiment shown, referring also to Figures 7-11, the exterior assembly 102
includes an insulator 156 that is received within the rear portion of the cylinder guard cover
 108. The insulator 156 is formed from an electrical insulator material, such as Polycarbonate
PC-I 10 by Chi Mei Corporation of Taiwan. In this example, the insulator 156 includes a
recessed portion 158 that houses several internal components. In the example shown, an o
ring 160, a light pipe 162, a PCB board 164, and a conductive wave washer 166 are housed in
the recessed portion 158 between the insulator 156 and the cylinder guard cover 108.
[0054]    In the example shown, the light communication device 118 is a light pipe 162. As
shown, referring also to Figures 19-24, the light pipe 162 includes a recessed portion 163 on
the front end that is dimensioned to receive the front cover 118. A flange 165, which is a
ring-shape in the embodiment shown, surrounding the front cover 118 can be selectively
illuminated. Accordingly, in the embodiment shown, the flange 165 or ring surrounding the
front cover 118 may light up during operation. As discussed above, for example, the light
pipe 162 may include a plurality of regions that are independently controllable to visually
display messages to the user, which could be animations in some embodiments. In some
embodiments, the light pipe 162 is translucent or transparent. By way of example only, the

                                               10
light pipe 162 could be made from a product called Polycarbonate PC-1 10 by Chi Mei
Corporation of Taiwan. As shown, the light pipe 162 includes a groove dimensioned to
receive a seal, which is an o-ring 160 in this example. The o-ring prevents moisture from
entering the front portion 112 of the exterior assembly 102. In the example shown, fasteners
168 extend through the light pipe 162 PCB board and insulator 156 to connect within threaded
openings 170 of a cylinder housing 172.
[0055]    Referring also to Figures 12-18, the cylinder housing (also called cylinder guard) 172
provides impact strength and structural reinforcement for the exterior locking assembly 102.
For example, the cylinder housing 172 may be formed from a zinc alloy in some
embodiments. In the embodiment shown, the cylinder housing 172 is received in a rear
portion of the insulator 156. As shown, the cylinder housing 172 includes a cavity 174 that is
configured to receive an antenna. Despite having a cavity in the cylinder housing 172, the
cylinder housing 172 provides sufficient reinforcement for the exterior assembly 102 in tests.
[0056]    A clip 176 retains a rear portion of the mechanical locking assembly 116 within the
exterior assembly 102. A retainer 178 and plate 180 are attached to a rear portion of the
cylinder housing 172 for added tamper resistance and structural reinforcement of the cylinder
housing 172. Fasteners 182, 184 are received within threaded openings in the back portion of
the cylinder housing 172 to fasten the retainer 178 and plate 180.
[0057]    Figure 4 is a front perspective view of the external assembly 102 with a portion
removed to expose internal components. In this view, the cavity 174 formed in the cylinder
housing 172 can be seen. This allows an antenna to be internal to the exterior assembly 102
(within the cylinder housing 172 as shown) to transmit signals outside the exterior assembly
102. With an antenna on the front portion of the exterior assembly 102, behind the light pipe
162 and front cover 114, which are both plastic, this allows wireless signals to be transmitted
out of the exterior assembly 102. From this view, it can also be seen that the flange 165 of the

                                                I Y
light pipe 162 extends around the front cover 118, which can be used to communicate with the
user.
[0058]    Figure 5 is a side cross-sectional view of a portion of the exterior assembly 102. As
shown, an air gap 186 is formed by the insulator 156 between the cylinder guard cover 108
and the cylinder housing 172. The insulator 156 also separates the touch surface, which is the
cylinder guard cover 108 in this example from the PCB 164 that hosts the touch electronics.
In this example, a conductive wave washer 166 is compressed between the PCB 164 and the
cylinder guard cover 108 to make electrical contact. With this electrical connector, the PCB
 164 can sense when a user touches anywhere on the cylinder guard cover 108. Although the
cylinder guard 108 is shown for purposes of example, the touch surface could be any
mechanical feature of a lockset, including but not limited to a cylinder guard cover, cylinder
guard, cylinder, keyway, handle, rose, or other exterior/interior features of a lockset.
Although a conductive wave washer 166 is shown for purposes of example, the conductive
medium could be a conductive foam, conductive tape, conductive grease, or any other
mechanical device electrically connecting the touch surface of the lockset to the PCB that
hosts the touch electronics. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 27. Also visible from
the view is the cavity 174 for housing the antenna.
[0059]    Figure 6 is a rear perspective view of the exterior assembly 102. As can be seen in
this example, the torque blade 120 extends from the rear portion of the exterior assembly for
actuating the spindle 138 and the latch assembly 104. This view also shows the plate 180 and
retainer 178 that have been attached to the rear portion of the cylinder housing 172.
[0060]    Figures 28-31 show an example of how the light pipe 162 (which is shown
diagrammatically) may be used to communicate with the user. In the example shown, the
light pipe includes a plurality of regions that may be independently illuminated or adjusted by
intensity or color. These regions may be illuminated in a coordinated manner to display

                                              LV
information about the exterior assembly 102, such as a static image (e.g., solid or flashing the
same regions) or as an animation (e.g., illuminating regions in a particular sequence). In the
example shown, the light pipe 162 includes a first region 188, a second region 190, a third
region 192, a fourth region 194, a fifth region 196, a sixth region 198, a seventh region 200,
and an eighth region 202. Although eight regions are shown in this example, more or fewer
regions could be used. Although these regions are represented by a circle, these are merely
shown for purposes of example to indicate a region of the light pipe 162 that may be
independently drivable. Consider an example in which the user has provided an
authentication code to the lock assembly 100 and would like to touch the cylinder guard cover
 108 to unlock the lock assembly 100. One example communication that may be made by the
light pipe 162 could be indicating the direction of movement of the bolt 124. If the bolt 124
was moving to the right, for example, the light pipe 162 may illuminate regions in a sequence
to animate a clockwise movement. For example, the light pipe may first indicate the first and
second regions 188, 190, as shown in Figure 28. The next two regions 192, 194 may then be
illuminated and then the next regions 196, 198 and finally regions 200, 202 to show an
animation of a clockwise direction. If the bolt 124 was moving to the left, the animation
could be in the opposite direction. The light pipe 162 could be used to communicate a wide
variety of information, such as whether the lock assembly 100 is either in a locked state or in
an unlocked state. Moreover, in some embodiments, the light pipe 162 could be used to
request additional information from a user, such as requesting the user touch the touch surface
to either lock or unlock the lock assembly 100. If the user needs to touch the cylinder guard
cover 108 multiple times to activate a certain function of the lock assembly 100, for example,
the light pipe 162 could indicate the number of touches by flashing that number of times.
Accordingly, the light pipe 162 acts as a user interface to communicate and interact with the
user.

                                               Z_1
[0061]    In operation, the user may approach the exterior assembly 102, which could cause
the light pipe 162 to illuminate to indicate the user is in range. If an authentication code
transmitted by the user to the lock assembly 100 is authenticate or recognized, the light pipe
 162 may indicate this, such as by flashing green or some sort of animation. The user may
then touch anywhere on the cylinder guard cover 108 to unlock the lock assembly 100. For
example, this may cause a motor to rotate the spindle driver 144, which rotates the torque
blade 120 to retract the bolt 124. As the lock assembly 100 is actuating the bolt to the
retracted position, the light pipe 162 may indicate this through some sort of animation, such as
a clockwise animation. When the bolt 124 has been fully retracted, the light pipe 162 may
indicate that the bolt 124 is unlocked. If there was an error in retracting the bolt 124, the light
pipe 162 could indicate this.
[0062]    Figures 32-39 show a battery contact assembly 210 for electrically connecting a
battery 212, such as a coin battery, to a PCB board 214 for supplying electrical power. In
some cases, this assembly could be in a key fob that interacts with the lock assembly 100. For
example, the PCB 214 could be configured to transmit wireless messages to the lock assembly
 100, such as security credentials. The battery contact assembly 210 is configured to provide a
low-profile key fob that is thinner than existing key fobs.
[0063]    In the embodiment shown, the battery contact assembly 210 includes a first contact
216 and a second contact 218. For example, the first contact 216 may connect a negative
terminal of the battery 212 to the PCB 214 while the second contact 218 may connect the
positive terminal of the battery 212. The first contact 216 includes a mounting portion 220 for
mounting the first contact to the PCB 214. The second contact 218 includes a mounting
portion 222 for mounting the second contact to the PCB 214. In the example shown, the
mounting portion 220 includes legs 220 that extend through holes 226 in the PCB 214 for
soldering the first contact 216 to the PCB 214 to establish an electrical connection between

the PCB 214 and the first contact 216. In the example shown, the mounting portion 220 is
mounted to the face of the PCB 214 (either the front or back as shown in Figures 34 and 35).
A projection 228 extends from the PCB 214 and is suspended above the second contact 218.
In the example shown, the projection 228 includes a straight portion 230 that extends along a
longitudinal axis of the PCB and an angled portion 232. The projection 228 includes a spring
234 surrounded by a holder 236. The spring 234 urges against a first side of the battery to
create a frictional fit with the second contact 218.
[0064]    In the example shown, the mounting portion 222 of the second contact 218 includes
legs 238 that extend through holes 240 in the PCB 214 for soldering the second contact 218 to
the PCB 214 to establish an electrical connection between the PCB 214 and the second
contact 218. In the example shown, the mounting portion 220 includes a face portion 242 and
an edge portion 244 to straddle the PCB 214 (See Figures 33-35). As shown, the edge portion
244 has a top end extending transverse from the face portion 242 and a bottom end with a
projection 246 extends from the PCB 214 and is positioned on an opposing side of the battery
212 than the first contact 216. As with the first contact 216, the second contact 218 can be
mounted to either the front or back of the PCB 214. In the example shown, the projection
246 includes a straight portion 248 that extends along a longitudinal axis of the PCB and an
angled portion 250. The projection 218 includes a spring 252 surrounded by a holder 254.
The spring 252 urges against a second side of the battery to create a frictional fit with the first
contact 216. In use, a user may slide a battery 212 between the first contact 216 and the
second contact 218. The urging of springs 234, 252 on opposing faces of battery 212 creates
a frictional fit to hold the battery 212 in place. Since the first contact 216 and the second
contact 218 have an electrical connection with the PCB 214, the battery 212 supplies power to
the PCB 214. If the user wants to remove the battery 212, the battery 212 may pulled out with
sufficient force to overcome the friction of the springs 234, 252.
