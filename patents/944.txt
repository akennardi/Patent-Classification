[0034]    The definitions of certain terms as used in this specification are provided below.
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
invention belongs.
                                                  9

    WO 2014/022551                                                          PCT/US2013/053007
[0035]     As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an"
and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For example,
reference to "a cell" includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like.
[0036]     As used herein, the "administration" of an agent, drug, or peptide to a subject
includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject a compound to perform its
intended function. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including orally,
intranasally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or
subcutaneously), or topically. Administration includes self-administration and the
administration by another.
[0037]     As used herein, the term "amino acid" includes naturally-occurring amino acids and
synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function
in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring amino acids
are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified,
e.g., hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers
to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino
acid, i.e., an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an
R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium.
Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but
retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acid
mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general
chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally
occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their commonly
known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB
Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.
[0038]     As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to achieve
a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, e.g., an amount which results in the
prevention of, or a decrease in, atherosclerosis or one or more symptoms associated with
atherosclerosis. In the context of therapeutic or prophylactic applications, the amount of a
composition administered to the subject will depend on the type and severity of the disease
and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and
tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree, severity and type of disease. The
skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other
                                                 10

    WO 2014/022551                                                         PCT/US2013/053007
factors. The compositions can also be administered in combination with one or more
additional therapeutic compounds. In the methods described herein, the aromatic-cationic
peptides may be administered to a subject having one or more signs or symptoms of
atherosclerosis. For example, a "therapeutically effective amount" of the aromatic-cationic
peptides is meant levels in which the physiological effects of atherosclerosis are, at a
minimum, ameliorated. In some embodiments, signs, symptoms or complications of
atherosclerosis include, but are not limited to: increased plasma total cholesterol, increased
plasma free cholesterol, increased plasma cholesterol ester, lesions (e.g. aortic lesions),
increased plasma very low-density lipoprotein, increased plasma low density lipoprotein
and/or increased plasma phospholipids.
[0039]    An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or peptide is substantially free of cellular
material or other contaminating polypeptides from the cell or tissue source from which the
agent is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized. For example, an isolated aromatic-cationic peptide would be free of
materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses of the agent. Such
interfering materials may include enzymes, hormones and other proteinaceous and
nonproteinaceous solutes.
[0040]    As used herein, the terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used
interchangeably herein to mean a polymer comprising two or more amino acids joined to
each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. Polypeptide
refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, glycopeptides or oligomers, and
to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids
other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. Polypeptides include amino acid sequences
modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical
modification techniques that are well known in the art.
[0041]    As used herein, the term "simultaneous" therapeutic use refers to the administration
of at least two active ingredients by the same route and at the same time or at substantially the
same time.
[0042]    As used herein, the term "separate" therapeutic use refers to an administration of at
least two active ingredients at the same time or at substantially the same time by different
routes.
                                                 11

    WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
[0043]    As used herein, the term "sequential" therapeutic use refers to administration of at
least two active ingredients at different times, the administration route being identical or
different. More particularly, sequential use refers to the whole administration of one of the
active ingredients before administration of the other or others commences. It is thus possible
to administer one of the active ingredients over several minutes, hours, or days before
administering the other active ingredient or ingredients. There is no simultaneous treatment
in this case.
[0044]    As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" or "alleviation" refers to both
therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to
prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. For example, a
subject is successfully "treated" for atherosclerosis if, after receiving a therapeutic amount of
the aromatic-cationic peptides according to the methods described herein, the subject shows
observable and/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more signs, symptoms or
complications of atherosclerosis, such as, e.g., reduced total plasma cholesterol, free
cholesterol, cholesterol ester, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), low
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), phospholipids, lesion size and/or number (e.g. aortic
lesions), lowered levels of cholesterol in the aortic tissue and/or aortic plaques, and/or
lowered levels of cholesterol atherosclerotic lesions or plaques as compared to a subject not
treated with the therapeutic aromatic-cationic peptide. It is also to be appreciated that the
various modes of treatment or prevention of medical conditions as described are intended to
mean "substantial," which includes total but also less than total treatment or prevention, and
wherein some biologically or medically relevant result is achieved.
[0045]    As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" of a disorder or condition refers to one
or more compounds that, in a statistical sample, reduces the occurrence of the disorder or
condition in the treated sample relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or
reduces the severity of one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the
untreated control sample. As used herein, preventing atherosclerosis includes reducing to, or
maintaining at, normal levels one or more signs, symptoms or complications of
atherosclerosis including, but not limited to total plasma cholesterol, free cholesterol,
cholesterol ester, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, phospholipids, lesion size and/or number (e.g. aortic lesions), levels of
cholesterol in the aortic tissue and/or aortic plaques, and/or levels of cholesterol

atherosclerotic lesions or plaques as compared to a subject not treated with the therapeutic
aromatic-cationic peptide.
[0046]    As used herein the terms "antihyperlipidemic agent" or "antihyperlipidemic drug"
are synonymous with the terms "hypolipidemic agent" or "hypolipidemic drug."
Methods of Prevention or Treatment
[0047]    The present technology relates to the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis by
administration of aromatic-cationic peptides and, in some embodiments, aromatic-cationic
peptides in conjunction with one or more active agents to a subject in need thereof. For
example, the present technology relates to the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis by
administration of aromatic-cationic peptides, and in some embodiments, an aromatic-cationic
peptide and one or more antihyperlipidemic drugs (e.g., statins) to a subject in need thereof.
[0048]    In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides and/or one or more agents are
administered in dosages that are sub-therapeutic for each agent when administered separately.
However, in some embodiments, the combination of the two agents results in synergism,
which provides an enhanced effect that is not observed when each of the agents are
administered individually at higher doses. In one embodiment, the administration of the
aromatic-cationic peptide and one or more agents "primes" the tissue, so that it is more
responsive to the therapeutic effects of the other agent. Thus, in some embodiments, a lower
dose of the aromatic-cationic peptide and/or the one or more agents (e.g., antihyperlipidemic
drugs, such as statins) can be administered, and yet, a therapeutic effect is still observed.
[0049]    In some embodiments, the subject (e.g, a subject suffering from atherosclerosis,
and/or exhibiting the signs, symptoms or complications of atherosclerosis, and/or who is
predisposed to atherosclerosis or the signs, symptoms or complications of atherosclerosis) is
administered the peptide, or is administered a peptide and one or more antihyperlipidemic
drugs (e.g., statins) simultaneously, separately, or sequentially. In some embodiments, the
subject is administered the peptide or is administered the peptide and one or more
antihyperlipidemic drugs (e.g., statins), before atherosclerosis or before the signs, symptoms
or complications of atherosclerosis are evident.
[0050]    Aromatic-cationic peptides are water-soluble and highly polar. Despite these
properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes. The aromatic-cationic peptides
                                                13

   WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
typically include a minimum of three amino acids or a minimum of four amino acids,
covalently joined by peptide bonds. The maximum number of amino acids present in the
aromatic-cationic peptides is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide bonds.
Suitably, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, more preferably about nine,
and most preferably about six.
[0051]    The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides can be any amino acid. As used
herein, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to any organic molecule that contains at least
one amino group and at least one carboxyl group. Typically, at least one amino group is at
the a position relative to a carboxyl group. The amino acids may be naturally occurring.
Naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, the twenty most common levorotatory
(L) amino acids normally found in mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg),
asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Gln), glutamic acid (Glu),
glycine (Gly), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys), methionine (Met),
phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine
(Tyr), and valine (Val). Other naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, amino
acids that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated with protein synthesis. For
example, the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are synthesized in mammalian metabolism
during the production of urea. Another example of a naturally occurring amino acid includes
hydroxyproline (Hyp).
[0052]    The peptides optionally contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids.
For example, the peptide may have no amino acids that are naturally occurring. The non
naturally occurring amino acids may be levorotary (L-), dextrorotatory (D-), or mixtures
thereof. Non-naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not
synthesized in normal metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally occur in
proteins. In addition, the non-naturally occurring amino acids suitably are also not
recognized by common proteases. The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at
any position in the peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at
the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C
terminus.
[0053]    The non-natural amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl
groups not found in natural amino acids. Some examples of non-natural alkyl amino acids
include a-aminobutyric acid, 0-aminobutyric acid, y-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminovaleric acid,
                                                 14

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
and r-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of non-natural aryl amino acids include ortho-,
meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of non-natural alkylaryl amino acids
include ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and y-phenyl-3-aminobutyric acid.
Non-naturally occurring amino acids include derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids.
The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example, include the addition of
one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
[0054]     For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2', 3',
4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or the 4', 5',
6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any chemical
group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups include
branched or unbranched C 1-C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl,
isobutyl, or t-butyl, C1-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, CI-C 4 alkylamino and CI-C 4
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva) and norleucine (Nle).
[0055]     Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide is the
derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the
peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or
secondary amine, e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another
example of derivatization includes esterification with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol.
Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine, arginine, or
histidine residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl
groups include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the C1
C4 alkyl groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
[0056]     The non-naturally occurring amino acids are preferably resistant, and more
preferably insensitive, to common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino
acids that are resistant or insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any
of the above-mentioned naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L-and/or D- non
naturally occurring amino acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins,
although they are found in certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than
the normal ribosomal protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino
acids are considered to be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
                                                  15

    WO 2014/022551                                                          PCT/US2013/053007
[0057]    In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides should have less than five,
preferably less than four, more preferably less than three, and most preferably, less than two
contiguous L-amino acids recognized by common proteases, irrespective of whether the
amino acids are naturally or non-naturally occurring. Optimally, the peptide has only D
amino acids, and no L-amino acids. If the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of
amino acids, at least one of the amino acids is preferably a non-naturally-occurring D-amino
acid, thereby conferring protease resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence
includes two or more contiguous basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common
proteases, such as endopeptidases and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include
arginine, lysine and histidine.
[0058]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should have a minimum number of net positive
charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid residues in the
peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH will be referred to
below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will be referred to
below as (r). The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at
physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal pH in the
cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the physiological pH of
a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in mammals may be
any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.
[0059]    "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive charges
and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide. In this
specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The
naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L
lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively
charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid. Typically, a peptide
has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and a negatively charged C-terminal
carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at physiological pH.
[0060]    In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between the
minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH (pm) and the total number of
amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1.
In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges
(pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007

[0061]     In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid
residues (r) wherein 2 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and
the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

[0062]     In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides have three
or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, suitably, a minimum
of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive charges.
[0063]     It is also important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (pt). The minimum
number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a). Naturally occurring amino acids
that have an aromatic group include the amino acids histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and
phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide Lys-Gln-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Trp has a net positive
charge of two (contributed by the lysine and arginine residues) and three aromatic groups
(contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan residues).
[0064]     The aromatic-cationic peptides should also have a relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at
physiological pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1,
except that when pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is
as follows:

wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1. In this embodiment, the
relationship between the minimum number of aromatic amino acid residues (a) and the total
number of net positive charges (p1) is as follows:

[0066]    In another embodiment, the number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of
net positive charges (p1 ) are equal. In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide is a
tripeptide having two net positive charges and at least one aromatic amino acid. In a
particular embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide is a tripeptide having two net positive
charges and two aromatic amino acids.
[0067]    Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal amino acid,
are suitably amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal amide.
Alternatively, the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be amidated
with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for example, be
an alkyl, especially a branched or unbranched C 1-C 4 alkyl, or an aryl amine. Accordingly,
the amino acid at the C-terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido, N
methylamido, N-ethylamido, N,N-dimethylamido, N,N-diethylamido, N-methyl-N
ethylamido, N-phenylamido or N-phenyl-N-ethylamido group. The free carboxylate groups
of the asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues not occurring at the C
terminus of the aromatic-cationic peptides may also be amidated wherever they occur within
the peptide. The amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any of the
primary or secondary amines described above.

[0070]     The peptides mentioned herein and their derivatives can further include functional
analogs. A peptide is considered a functional analog if the analog has the same function as
the stated peptide. The analog may, for example, be a substitution variant of a peptide,
wherein one or more amino acids are substituted by another amino acid. Suitable substitution
variants of the peptides include conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino acids may be
grouped according to their physicochemical characteristics as follows:
         (a)      Non-polar amino acids: Ala(A) Ser(S) Thr(T) Pro(P) Gly(G) Cys (C);
         (b)      Acidic amino acids: Asn(N) Asp(D) Glu(E) Gln(Q);
         (c)      Basic amino acids: His(H) Arg(R) Lys(K);
         (d)      Hydrophobic amino acids: Met(M) Leu(L) Ile(I) Val(V); and
         (e)      Aromatic amino acids: Phe(F) Tyr(Y) Trp(W) His (H).
[0071]     Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the same group
is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical
characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide
by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter the characteristics
of the original peptide.

         Statin structure
[0097]    As noted above, in some embodiments, the peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as acetate or trifluoroacetate salt is administered
simultaneous to the statin. In some embodiments, the peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as acetate or trifluoroacetate salt is administered
prior to or subsequent to the statin. Typically, the structural components of statins include a
dihydroxyheptanoic acid unit and a ring system with different substituents. The statin
pharmacophore is modified hydroxyglutaric acid component, which is structurally similar to
the endogenous substrate HMG CoA and the mevaldyl CoA transition state intermediate.
The statin pharmacophore binds to the same active site as the substrate HMG-CoA and
                                                30

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
inhibits the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. The HMG-CoA reductase enzyme is
stereoselective and as a result functional statins typically have the 3R,5R stereochemistry.
[0098]    Statins can be separated into two classes: type 1 (e.g. lovastatin, pravastatin,
simvastatin); and type 2 (e.g. fluvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin). Type 1
statins include a substituted decalin-ring structure that resemble mevastatin, a compound
isolated from the mold Penicilliumcitrinum. Lovastatin was isolated from the mold
Aspergillus terreus and pravastatin and simvastatin are chemically modified versions of
lovastatin. Type 2 statins are fully synthetic and have larger substituent groups that interact
with the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. In addition, type 2 statins substitute fluorophenyl
group for the butyryl group found on type 1 statins. The fluorophenyl group provides
additional polar interactions typically resulting in tighter binding with the HMG-CoA
reductase enzyme. Rosuvastatin has a sulfonamide group that is hydrophilic and increases
binding affinity with the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme.
         Atorvastatin structure
[0099]    Atorvastatin is a ring-opened hydroxy-acid of trans-6-[2-(3- or 4-carboxamido
substituted pyrrol-1-yl)alkyl]-4-hydroxypyran-2-one (see e.g., Figure 6A for the chemical
structure). The general structure of atorvastatin and related compounds is provided in

[0107]    The term "aryl" refers to C6 to C12 aromatic group including phenyl, tolyl, xylyl,
biphenyl, naphthyl, and the like. The aryl may have 1 to 3 substituents independently selected
from the group consisting of lower alkyl, halogen, amino, and cyano. Preferred aryl is phenyl
substituted by 1 to 3 halogens.
[0108]    The term "aralkyl" refers to C1 to C6 lower alkyl substituted by C6 to C12 aromatic
aryl group defined above. Examples of them are benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl and the
like, each of which may have 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group
consisting of lower alkyl halogen, amino, cyano, and the like.
[0109]    The term "a cation capable of forming a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt"
refers to alkali metal ion, alkaline earth metal ion, and ammonium ion. Examples of alkali
metal are lithium, sodium, potassium, and cesium, and examples of alkaline earth metal are
beryllium, magnesium, and calcium. Especially, sodium and calcium are preferred.
[0110]    Examples of "acyl" are formyl acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl, and
isovaleryl.

         LIPITOR@ and CRESTOR@
[0114]    Atorvastatin (also known by the trademarked name LIPITOR@) can be used to
reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in
patients without coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors. Such risk factors
include but are not limited to age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of
early coronary heart disease. Atorvastatin can also be used to reduce the risk of myocardial
infarction and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease, but with
                                                 33

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
multiple risk factors. Such risk factors include but are not limited to retinopathy,
albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension. Atorvastatin can be used to reduce the risk of non
fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for coronary
heart failure, and angina in patients with coronary heart disease. Atorvastatin can be used to
reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoB, and triglyceride levels and increase HDL-C
in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilal) and
mixed dyslipidemia. Atorvastatin can be used to reduce elevated triglycerides in patients
with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia. Atorvastatin can also be
used to reduce total cholesterol and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Atorvastatin can be used to reduced elevated total cholesterol,
LDL-C, and ApoB levels in boys and postmenarchal girls between the ages of 10-17, with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy.
[0115]     Atorvastatin has also been used to treat spinal cord injury in rodents, promoting
locomotion and tissue sparing, as well as reducing inflammation when administered both pre
and post-injury. In addition, atorvastatin has been utilized in an in vitro model of hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection (alone and with interferon). In such a system, atorvastatin (as well as
lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin) was shown to have an anti-HCV effect.
Accordingly, statins may be suitable for concurrent therapy with interferon.
[0116]     Rosuvastatin (also known by the trade name CRESTOR@) can be used to treat
patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce
levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoB, nonHDL-C, and triglyceride levels and to increase
levels of HDL-C. Rosuvastatin can also be used to treat patients with: hypertriglyceridemia
as an adjunct to diet, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type II hyperlipoproteinemia) as an
adjunct to diet, and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Rosuvastatin can be
used to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in patients as part of a treatment strategy to
lower total cholesterol and LDL-C as an adjunct to diet. Rosuvastatin can be used to treat
patients 10 to 17 years old with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to
reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and ApoB after failing an adequate trial of diet
therapy. Rosuvastatin can be used for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
arterial revascularization procedures in patients without evident coronary heart disease, but
with multiple risk factors. Such risk factors include hypertension, low HDL-C, smoking, or a
family history of premature coronary heart disease.

         Therapeutic Uses of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides and Active Agents
         Atherosclerosis
[0117]     The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful to prevent or treat disease
such as atherosclerosis. The combination of peptides and active agents, such as those
described above (e.g., antihyperlipidemic agents such as statins) are useful in treating any
atherosclerosis, as well as the signs, symptoms or complications of atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in
which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as
cholesterol. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that can remain asymptomatic for decades.
It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels, a chronic inflammatory response in the walls
of arteries, caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and
promoted by low-density lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and
triglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by
functional high density lipoproteins (HDL). It is commonly referred to as a hardening or
furring of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries.
[0118]     The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is complicated but generally, stable
atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and
smooth muscle cells, while unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the
extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous
cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic
material, such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the
lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary
occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation and can eventually occlude
smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism (e.g., stroke is often caused by
thrombus formation in the carotid arteries). Apart from thromboembolism, chronically
expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically
expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply
to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient resulting in ischemia.
[0119]     These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive
and cumulative. In some instances, soft plaques suddenly rupture, causing the formation of a
thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the
artery (infarction). Coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery is also a common complication
                                                 35

    WO 2014/022551                                                             PCT/US2013/053007
which can lead to myocardial infarction. Blockage of an artery to the brain may result in
stroke. In advanced atherosclerotic disease, claudication from insufficient blood supply to
the legs, typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments
narrowed with clots, may occur.
[0120]     Atherosclerosis can affect the entire artery tree, but larger, high-pressure vessels
such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries are typically at greater risk.
[0121]     Signs, symptoms and complications of atherosclerosis include, but are not limited to
increased plasma total cholesterol, VLDL-C, LDL-C, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester,
triglycerides, phospholipids and the presence of lesions (e.g., plaques) in arteries, as
discussed above. In some embodiments, increased cholesterol (e.g., total cholesterol, free
cholesterol and cholesterol esters) can be seen in one or more of plasma, aortic tissue and
aortic plaques.
[0122]     Predisposion to atherosclerosis is also a concern. Accordingly, the present
disclosure relates to methods of administering aromatic-cationic peptides alone, or in
combination with one or more antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., statins), to prevent
atherosclerosis, or the signs, symptoms or complications thereof. In some embodiments a
subject predisposed to atherosclerosis may exhibit one or more of the following
characteristics: advanced age, a family history of heart disease, a biological condition, high
blood cholesterol. In some embodiments, the biological condition comprises high levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood, low levels of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the blood, hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes,
excess body weight, obesity, sleep apnea, lifestyle choice and/or a behavioral habit. In some
embodiments, the behavioral habit comprises smoking and/or alcohol use. In some
embodiments, the lifestyle choice comprises an inactive lifestyle and/or a high stress level.
         Statin-related side effects
[0123]     In some embodiments, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure (e.g., D
Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 ), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof such as acetate
salt or trifluoroacetate salt, are administered with one or more hypolipidemic agents (e.g.,
statins). In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure delay
onset, ameliorate, inhibit or eliminate the side-effects and/or toxicity of hypolipeidemic agent
(e.g.,statin). In some embodiments, the peptides ameliorate organ damage caused by
                                                 36

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
hypolipidemic agents. In some embodiments, the peptides ameliorate liver damage, kidney
damage, renal toxicity or rhabdomyolysis. In some embodiments, the peptides ameliorate
symptoms associated with the toxic side effects of hypolipidemic agents, including but not
limited to muscle weakness, muscle tenderness, malaise, headache, fever, dark urine, nausea,
and vomiting.
         Hypolipidemic agent dosage
[0124]     In some embodiments, administration of aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
technology in conjunction with one or more hypolipidemic agents such as statins, permits a
higher dose of the hypolipidemic agent to be administered to a subject than would otherwise
be tolerated by the subject. Also disclosed herein are methods for increasing a hypolipidemic
(e.g., statin) dose in a subject in need thereof, or allowing administration of a hypolipidemic
(e.g., statin) to a subject who would normally be contraindicated for statin treatment (e.g., in
a subject who exhibits negative side effects related to statin administration at an effective
dose). Exemplary negative side effects are described above and in more detail below, and
include but are not limited to muscle weakness and organ damage.
[0125]     In some embodiments, by ameliorating the toxic or negative side effects of the
hypolipidemic agent, the dose of hypolipidemic agent may be increased to a level sufficient
to achieve a target blood lipid level.
[0126]     In some embodiments, the target blood lipid level is a total cholesterol level. In
some embodiments, the target cholesterol level is less than about 200 mg/dL. In some
embodiments, the target cholesterol level is from about 130 to about 200 mg/dL. In some
embodiments, the target cholesterol level is less than about 200, less than about 190, less than
about 180, less than about 170, less than about 160, less than about 150, less than about 140,
or less than about 130 mg/dL.
[0127]     Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the target blood lipid level is a
target LDL level. In some embodiments, the target LDL level is less than about 100 mg/dL.
In some embodiments, the target LDL level is from about 50 to about 100 mg/dL. In some
embodiments, the target LDL level is less than about 100, less than about 90, less than about
80, less than about 70, less than about 60, or less than about 50 mg/dL.
                                                  37

    WO 2014/022551                                                             PCT/US2013/053007
[0128]     Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the target blood lipid level is a
target HDL level. In some embodiments, the target HDL level is greater than about 60
mg/dL. In some embodiments, the target HDL level is from about 30 to about 65 mg/dL. In
some embodiments, the target HDL level is greater than about 30, greater than about 35,
greater than about 40, greater than about 45, greater than about 50, greater than about 55,
greater than about 60, or greater than about 65 mg/dL.
[0129]     Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the target blood lipid level is a
target triglyceride level. In some embodiments, the target triglyceride level is less than about
200 mg/dL. In some embodiments, the target triglyceride level is from about 140 to about
200 mg/dL. In some embodiments, the target triglyceride level is less than about 140, less
than about 150, less than about 160, less than about 170, less than about 180, less than about
190, or less than about 200 mg/dL.
[0130]     By way of example, but not by way of limitation, in some embodiments, a subject
with an unsuitable/unhealthy lipid level is administered a first dosage level of an
anithyperlipidemic agent (e.g., a statin) to achieve a target lipid level, in combination with a
first dosage level of an aromatic-cationic peptide of the present disclosure (e.g., D-Arg-2'6'
Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2) at t=0. In some embodiments, the subject is administered the
anithyperlipidemic agent, or is administered an anithyperlipidemic agent and a peptide at the
first dosage level for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks,
month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years or
10 years. In some embodiments, the subject is administered the anithyperlipidemic agent, or
is administered an anithyperlipidemic agent and a peptide at the first dosage level once per
day, twice per day, every other day, once every third day, fourth day, fifth day, once per
week, or once every other week.
[0131]     At a later time (t=1) (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3
weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or 2 years) after taking the
anithyperlipidemic agent, or the anithyperlipidemic agent and the peptide at the first dosage
level, the subject's lipid levels and any negative or toxic side effects characteristic of the
anithyperlipidemic agent are evaluated. In some embodiments, due to the positive effects of
the peptpide, the subject exhibits no negative or toxic side effects of the anithyperlipidemic
agent. In some embodiments, the dosage level of the antihyperlipidemic agent is increased to
a second dosage level to more quickly or effectively achieve an acceptable (e.g., target) lipid
                                                  38

    WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
level. In some embodiments, the peptide dosage level remains constant, e.g., is equal to the
first dosage level. In some embodiments, the peptide dosage level is increased, e.g., is
greater than the first dosage level. In some embodiments, the peptide dosage level is
decreased, e.g., is less than the first dosage level. In some embodiment, no additional peptide
is administered with the second dosage level of the antihyperlipidemic agent. In some
embodiments, peptide is administered as often as the antihyperlipidemic agent. In some
embodiments, the peptide is administered more or less frequtently than the
antihyperlipidemic agent.
[0132]     In some embodiments, the subject's lipid levels and any negative or toxic side
effects characteristic of the anithyperlipidemic agent are evaluated at t=2, t=3, etc. In some
embodiments, the dosage level of the antihyperlipidemic agent is increased to a third, fourth,
fifth, etc. dosage level to more quickly or effectively achieve a target lipid level. In some
embodiments, at t=2, 3, etc. the peptide dosage level may decreased, increased, remain the
same (e.g., first dosage level) or be omitted from one or more administrations.
                 Coenzyme Q10 levels
[0133]     The statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and the like) are
hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. By inhibiting this
enzyme, statins reduce the synthesis of mevalonate, an intermediary in the cholesterol
synthesis pathway. The same biosynthetic pathway is shared by coenzyme QI; mevalonate
is also a precursor of coenzyme Q10. Thus, both cholesterol and coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis
decrease with statin treatment.
[0134]      Some of the side effects of statins include mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased
coenzyme Q10 levels, a variety of myopathies (ranging from mild myalgia to fatal
rhabdomyolysis), diabetes, kidney failure and memory loss. Additional side effects include
fever, dark colored urine, swelling, weight gain, changes in urination frequency, dry mouth,
drowsiness, nausea, diarrhea, jaundice, loss of appetite, insomnia, and headache.
[0135]     Coenzyme QI (CoQ10) is a naturally occurring, fat-soluble quinone that is
localized in hydrophobic portions of cellular membranes. Approximately half of the body's
CoQ 10 is obtained through dietary fat ingestion, whereas the remainder results from
endogenous synthesis. Coenzyme QI participates in electron transport during oxidative
phosphorylation in mitochondria, protects against oxidative stress produced by free radicals,
                                                  39

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
and regenerates active forms of the antioxidants ascorbic acid and tocopherol (vitamin E).
Given the role of CoQ 10 in mitochondrial energy production and the importance of
mitochondria in muscle function, it is likely that statin-induced CoQ 10 deficiency plays a role
in statin-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and myopathies (e.g., rhabdomyolysis).
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is also possible that CoQ 10 plays a role in
additional statin-induced side effects, such as but not limited to memory loss, kidney failure
and diabetes.
[0136]    As shown in Example 3 and Figure 5, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
disclosure increase CoQ10 levels in fibroblast cells. Accordingly, in some embodiments,
aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are administered with one or more statins
to alleviate or prevent the myopathic side effects of statin administration. The peptide may
be administered before, simultaneously with, or after statin administration. The reason for
statin administration is not intended to limit peptide administration. That is, the subject may
be suffering from, or at risk for, any number of disease, conditions or illnesses for which one
or more statins are indicated.
[0137]    By way of example, but not by way of limitation, exemplary diseases, conditions,
risk factors, characteristics, or reasons for administering a statin include one or more of the
following: advanced age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, a family history of early
coronary heart disease, an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in subjects with
type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease, but with other or multiple risk factors (e.g.,
retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension), to reduce the risk of non-fatal MI, fatal
and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for coronary heart failure,
or angina in patients with coronary heart disease, to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C,
ApoB, and triglyceride levels and increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary
hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilal) and mixed dyslipidemia, to reduce
elevated triglycerides in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary
dysbetalipoproteinemia, to reduce total cholesterol and LDL-C in patients with homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and
ApoB levels in boys and postmenarchal girls between the ages of 10-17, with heterozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy, to treat patients
with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce levels of
total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoB, nonHDL-C, and triglyceride levels and to increase levels of
                                                 40

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
HDL-C, to treat patients with: hypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to diet, primary
dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type II hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct to diet, and
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), to slow the progression of
atherosclerosis in patients as part of a treatment strategy to lower total cholesterol and LDL-C
as an adjunct to diet, to treat patients 10 to 17 years old with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and ApoB after
failing an adequate trial of diet therapy, to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke,
and arterial revascularization procedures in patients without evident coronary heart disease,
but with multiple risk factors (e.g., hypertension, low HDL-C, smoking, or a family history of
premature coronary heart disease), to reduce inflammation, promote locomotion, and promote
tissue sparing in spinal cord injury, and/or to reduce or eliminate infection of HCV in a
patient.
[0138]    In addition, in some embodiments, the administration of one or more aromatic
cationic peptides of the present disclosure in combination with one or more statins statin will
allow the subject to receive a higher dose of one or more statins to alleviate a disease,
conditions, or a sign, symptom or characteristic of a disease or condition. By way of example
but not by way of limitation, the label on the statin CRESTOR@ emphasizes the risks (e.g.,
myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and various forms of kidney failure) at the highest approved does
of 40 mg, and recommends administration of lower doses. By administering an aromatic
cationic peptide with the statin, the detrimental side effects seen with higher dosages may
delayed, ameliorated or eliminated, thereby allowing for administration of the higher
therapeutic statin dose.
         General
[0139]    The disclosure also provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of
treating a subject having or at risk of (or susceptible to) atherosclerosis and related
complications. Accordingly, the present methods provide for the prevention and/or treatment
of atherosclerosis in a subject by administering an effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide and one or more active agents, such as an antihyperlipidemic drug (e.g., a statin) to a
subject in need thereof.
[0140]    In various embodiments, suitable in vitro or in vivo assays are performed to
determine the effect of a specific combination of aromatic-cationic peptides and one or more
                                                  41

    WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
active agents and whether its administration is indicated for treatment. In various
embodiments, assays can be performed with representative animal models to determine if a
given aromatic-cationic peptide and cardiovascular agent treatment regime exerts the desired
effect in preventing or treating atherosclerosis. Compounds for use in therapy can be tested
in suitable animal model systems including, but not limited to rats, mice, chicken, pigs, cows,
monkeys, rabbits, and the like, prior to testing in human subjects. Any of the animal model
systems known in the art can be used prior to administration to human subjects.
[0141]    In therapeutic applications, compositions or medicaments are administered to a
subject suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in an amount sufficient to cure,
or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease, including its complications and
intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease. As such, the present
disclosure provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with atherosclerosis.
         Exemplary Modes of Administration, Formulations and Effective Dosages
[0142]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue with a
peptide and active agent may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in
vivo methods. In vivo methods typically include the administration of an aromatic-cationic
peptide and active agent, such as those described above, to a mammal, suitably a human.
When used in vivo for therapy, the aromatic-cationic peptides and active agents may be
administered to the subject in effective amounts (i.e., amounts that have desired therapeutic
effect). The dose and dosage regimen will depend upon the degree of the injury in the
subject, the characteristics of the particular aromatic-cationic peptide and/or additional active
agent used, e.g., its therapeutic index, the subject, and the subject's history.
[0143]    The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical trials
by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. An effective amount of a peptide and one
or more additional active agents useful in the methods may be administered to a mammal in
need thereof by any of a number of well-known methods for administering pharmaceutical
compounds. The peptide may be administered systemically or locally.
[0144]    The compound may be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is
acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable
mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts are
                                                 42

not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate compounds
that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a peptide contains
both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as a
carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term
"salt" as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include
ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous,
potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically
acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including
substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine,
betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2
diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N
ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine,
isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine, polyamine
resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine,
tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids
include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric or
hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids (e.g.,
citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids),
amino acids (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., benzoic, p
chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic
hydroxyl acids (e.g., o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2
carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids (e.g.,
fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic, orotic,
pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (e.g., benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic,
ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene- 1,5-disulfonic,
naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the like. In some
embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is acetate or trifluoroacetate salt.
[0145]     The compounds described herein can be incorporated into pharmaceutical
compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for the treatment or

    WO 2014/022551                                                          PCT/US2013/053007
prevention of a disorder described herein. Such compositions typically include the active
agent (e.g., peptide and one or more active agents, e.g., a statin) and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier. As used herein the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes
saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and
absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration.
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.
[0146]     Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral
(e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation, transdermal
(topical), intraocular, iontophoretic, and transmucosal administration. Solutions or
suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the
following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,
polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial
agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or
sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as
acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium
chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or
sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable
syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. For convenience of the patient or
treating physician, the dosing formulation can be provided in a kit containing all necessary
equipment (e.g., vials of drug, vials of diluent, syringes and needles) for a treatment course.
[0147]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,
suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for
parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and
must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi.
[0148]     The pharmaceutical compositions can include a carrier, which can be a solvent or
dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol,

propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof.
The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin,
by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of
surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic
acid, thiomerasol, and the like. Glutathione and other antioxidants can be included to prevent
oxidation. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars,
polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the
composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or
gelatin.
[0149]    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound(s)
in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of
preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the active
ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution
thereof.
[0150]    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds can be incorporated with
excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral
compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash.
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as
part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of
the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline
cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating
agent such as alginic acid, primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or
sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or
saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.

    WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
[0151]    For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an
aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Such methods include, but are not limited
to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,798.
[0152]     Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be
by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration,
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal
administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays. For transdermal
administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams
as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may be
performed by iontophoresis.
[0153]    A therapeutic agent can be formulated in a carrier system. The carrier can be a
colloidal system. The colloidal system can be a liposome, a phospholipid bilayer vehicle. In
one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide is encapsulated in a liposome while maintaining
peptide integrity. As one skilled in the art would appreciate, there are a variety of methods to
prepare liposomes (see Lichtenberg et al., Methods Biochem. Anal., 33:337-462 (1988);
Anselem et al., Liposome Technology, CRC Press (1993)). Liposomal formulations can
delay clearance and increase cellular uptake (see Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915
923 (2000)). An active agent can also be loaded into a particle prepared from
pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients including, but not limited to, soluble, insoluble,
permeable, impermeable, biodegradable or gastroretentive polymers or liposomes. Such
particles include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles, biodegradable nanoparticles,
microparticles, biodegradable microparticles, nanospheres, biodegradable nanospheres,
microspheres, biodegradable microspheres, capsules, emulsions, liposomes, micelles and
viral vector systems.
[0154]    The carrier can also be a polymer, e.g., a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer
matrix. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide can be embedded in the polymer matrix,
while maintaining protein integrity. The polymer may be natural, such as polypeptides,
proteins or polysaccharides, or synthetic, such as poly a-hydroxy acids. Examples include
carriers made of, e.g., collagen, fibronectin, elastin, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate,

polysaccharide, fibrin, gelatin, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer is
poly-lactic acid (PLA) or copoly lactic/glycolic acid (PGLA). The polymeric matrices can be
prepared and isolated in a variety of forms and sizes, including microspheres and
nanospheres. Polymer formulations can lead to prolonged duration of therapeutic effect (see
Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). A polymer formulation for human
growth hormone (hGH) has been used in clinical trials (see Kozarich and Rich, Chemical
Biology, 2:548-552 (1998)).
[0155]    Examples of polymer microsphere sustained release formulations are described in,
but not limited to PCT publication WO 99/15154 (Tracy et al.), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and
5,716,644 (both to Zale et al.), PCT publication WO 96/40073 (Zale et al.), and PCT
publication WO 00/38651 (Shah et al.). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 and PCT
publication WO 96/40073 describe a polymeric matrix containing particles of erythropoietin
that are stabilized against aggregation with a salt.
[0156]    In some embodiments, the therapeutic compounds are prepared with carriers that
will protect the therapeutic compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a
controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylacetic acid. Such
formulations can be prepared using known techniques. The materials can also be obtained
commercially, e.g., from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal
suspensions (including liposomes targeted to specific cells with monoclonal antibodies to
cell-specific antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be
prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.
[0157]    The therapeutic compounds can also be formulated to enhance intracellular delivery.
For example, liposomal delivery systems are known in the art, see, e.g., Chonn and Cullis,
"Recent Advances in Liposome Drug Delivery Systems," Current Opinion in Biotechnology
6:698-708 (1995); Weiner, "Liposomes for Protein Delivery: Selecting Manufacture and
Development Processes," Immunomethods, 4(3):201-9 (1994); and Gregoriadis, "Engineering
Liposomes for Drug Delivery: Progress and Problems," Trends Biotechnol., 13(12):527-37
(1995). Mizguchi et al., CancerLett., 100:63-69 (1996), describes the use of fusogenic
liposomes to deliver a protein to cells both in vivo and in vitro.

    WO 2014/022551                                                           PCT/US2013/053007
[0158]    In some embodiments, at least one antihyperlipidemic agent (e.g. statin), and at least
one aromatic cationic peptide as described above, are associated to form a complex. The
antihyperlipidemic agent and aromatic cationic peptide can associate by any method known
to those in the art. Suitable types of associations include chemical bonds and physical bonds.
Chemical bonds include, for example, covalent bonds and coordinate bonds. Physical bonds
include, for instance, hydrogen bonds, dipolar interactions, van der Waal forces, electrostatic
interactions, hydrophobic interactions and aromatic stacking. In some embodiments, bonds
between the compounds are rapidly degraded or dissolved; in some embodiments, bonds are
cleaved by drug metabolizing or excretatory chemistry and/or enzymes.
[0159]    For a chemical bond or physical bond, a functional group on the molecule typically
associates with a functional group on the aromatic cationic peptide. For example, statins
often contain a carboxyl functional group, as well as hydroxyl functional groups. The free
amine group of an aromatic cationic peptide may be crosslinked directly to the carboxl group
of a statin using 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC or
EDAC) or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). Cross-linking agents can, for example, be
obtained from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL. The Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.
website can provide assistance.
[0160]    Linkers that that are cleaved within a cell may also be used. For example, the
carboxyl group of a statin may be attached to a linker, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
7,989,434, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, which links the statin to an
aromatic cationic peptide. Once the statin-peptide complex enters the cell or blood stream,
the linker is cleaved releasing the peptide from the statin. The compositions disclosed herein
are not intended to be limited by linkers or cleavage means. For example, in some
embodiments, linkers are cleaved in the body (e.g., in the blood stream, interstitial tissue,
gastrointestinal tract, etc.), releasing the peptide from the second active agent (e.g., a statin)
via enzymes (e.g., esterases) or other chemical reactions.
[0161]    In some embodiments, the antihyperlipidemic agent and an aromatic cationic
peptide of the present disclosure may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical
composition comprising at least one of the compounds of this disclosure together with a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds
disclosed herein can be administered either individually or together in any conventional oral,
parenteral or transdermal dosage form. In some embodiments, the antihyperlipidemic agent
                                                  48

    WO 2014/022551                                                          PCT/US2013/053007
may be co-formulated in a fixed-dose combination with the aromatic cationic peptide. In
some embodiments, the antihyperlipidemic agent and the aromatic cationic peptide are
formulated in a capsule or pill for oral dosing in which the compounds are physically
separated. In such a formulation, one or both of the antihyperlipidemic agent and the
aromatic cationic peptide are in a solid, liquid, powder, or gel form. In some embodiments,
the antihyperlipidemic agent and the aromatic cationic peptide are in a fixed-dose
combination in which the two compounds are mixed together, for example in in a solid,
liquid, powder, or gel form.
[0162]     Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,
e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.
Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that
exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that
targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to
uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.
[0163]     The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no
toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed
and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods, the
therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can
be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that
includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half
maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be
used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be
measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.
[0164]     Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides and/or
cardiovascular agents, sufficient for achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range
from about 0.00000 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram
body weight per day. Preferably, the dosage ranges are from about 0.0001 mg per kilogram

body weight per day to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example
dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or
every three days or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every
three weeks. In one embodiment, a single dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000
micrograms per kg body weight. In one embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide
concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000 micrograms per delivered milliliter.
[0165]    In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide may be defined as a concentration of peptide at the target tissue of 10-11 to 10-6 molar,
e.g., approximately 10-7 molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic doses of
0.01 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses would be
optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, most preferably by
single daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous administration (e.g.,
parenteral infusion or transdermal application).
[0166]    In some embodiments, the dosage of the aromatic-cationic peptide is provided at a
"low," "mid," or "high" dose level. In one embodiment, the low dose is provided from about
0.0001 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.001 to about 0.1 mg/kg/h. In one
embodiment, the mid-dose is provided from about 0.01 to about 1.0 mg/kg/h, suitably from
about 0.01 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h. In one embodiment, the high dose is provided from about
0.5 to about 10 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/kg/h. In an illustrative
embodiment, the dose of cardiovascular agent is from about 1 to 100 mg/kg, suitably about
25 mg/kg.
[0167]    The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and
timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to, the severity of the
disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments.
[0168]    The mammal treated in accordance present methods can be any mammal, including,
for example, farm animals, such as sheep, pigs, cows, and horses; pet animals, such as dogs
and cats; laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits. In some embodiments, the
mammal is a human.

[0169]    The present technology is further illustrated by the following example, which should
not be construed as limiting in any way.
Example 1. Effects of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides in Protecting Against Atherosclerosis
in a Mouse Model
[0170]    The effects of aromatic-cationic peptides in protecting against atherosclerosis in a
mouse model were investigated.
[0171]    Apoprotein E deficient mice (Jackson Laboratories, 600 Main Street, Bar Harbor,
ME) were used in this study. The mice were male, 7-8 weeks of age, and between 18-20 g in
weight. An initial total cholesterol measurement was made on 30 mice, and the mice were
grouped into two groups of 15 to match the total cholesterol measurements. Both groups
were fed a "western diet" (40 kcal% butterfat, 0.15 % [wt/wt] cholesterol, Harlan Teklad diet
TD-88137). Starting at t = 0, the control group of 15 mice received vehicle only (phosphate
buffered saline at pH 7.4), while the test group of 15 mice received aromatic-cationic peptide
reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline. Body weights of the mice were recorded weekly,
and mortality checks were performed daily.
[0172]    The aromatic-cationic peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (sterile lyophilized
powder, reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline) was tested. For the 12-week study, test
mice received a single, daily dose of the peptide, subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg. Control mice
received a single daily dose of vehicle.
[0173]     ExperimentalProtocol/DataCollection. Blood was collected every four weeks
(orbital plexis) under isoflurane anesthesia (3%) and blood lipids were determined. Plasma
lipid analysis was conducted for both groups at t = 0, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Plasma lipid
analysis using an autoanalyzer included total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (Trigs),
phospholipids (PL), free cholesterol (FC), and cholesterol ester (CE, by calculation). Gel
electrophoresis was used to measure levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(VLDL-C).
[0174]    Histopathology/Histomorphometery: Following the 12 week treatment, mice were
euthanized within 48 hours after the last dose by CO 2 asphyxiation and the vascular tree was

perfused with 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). The aorta and aortic sinus were
removed for examination. Thoracic aorta were isolated, trimmed of fat, and fixed in formalin
for 48-72 hours before analysis. For en face analysis, aortas were laid out and pinned on
black matrix for photography, and stained with Sudan IV. Vessels were imaged for surface
involvement using a Nikon computerized image analysis system and the percent of the aortic
surface area covered by lipid was calculated. Two determinations were done for each image
(Quan 1 and Quan 2), and the average was computed. The data were then computed by
group and statistically analyzed. Following staining and morphometric analysis, total lipids
were extracted from the aortas using the Bligh-Dyer method. WAKO Diagnostics kits
(WAKO Diagnostics, Inc., 1600 Bellwood Road Richmond, VA 23237-1326) were then used
to evaluate total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and cholesterol ester. Cholesterol leves were
quantitate nad expressed relative to protein levels. Values are expressed as pig lipid per mg
protein (see e.g., Figure 1).
[0175]    For the aortic sinus, the heart and approximately 5 mm of the ascending aorta was
cut from the remainder of the aorta. The apex of the heart was removed and remaining heart
with the attached aortic segment was fixed and sectioned (in OCT medium and frozen in a
dry ice - 2 methylbutane bath). Serial 10 pim thick cryosections were made beginning with
the ascending aorta and proceeding through the entire aortic sinus until the ventricular
chamber was reached. The sections were stained with Oil Red 0 or Sudan IV and counter
stained with Harris hematoxylin. Alternate sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
The sinus was imaged at 5 step levels in the region of interest, i.e., the aortic root, for a total
distance of 300 pim and the lipid-staining areas and measured (total cross sectional area)
using a Nikon computerized image analysis system. The data were then computed by group
and statistically analyzed.
[0176]    Results are shown in the tables below and in Figures 1-4. Table 7 shows the en face
analysis of atherosclerotic lesions for each mouse in the study. Column 1: (sample ID #)
represents each mouse, 1-15 are control animals (received vehicle alone), and 16-20 are test
animals (received aromatic-cationic peptide); column 2: (Quan 1) shows a first determination
of % of the aortic surface covered by lipid for each mouse in the study; column 3 (Quan 2)
shows a second determination of % of the aortic surface covered by lipid for each mouse in
the study; column 4: shows the average % of the surface of the aorta showing lesions for each
mouse in the study; column 5 shows the average % of the surface of the aortas of control or

test mice showing lesions; column 5 shows the standard error of the mean for each group
(control or test animals). As shown in Table 7, treatment with the aromatic-cationic peptide
reduces atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. Aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
disclosure are therefore useful in treating atherosclerosis and related signs, symptoms and
complications of atherosclerosis.

[0181]    Results are further shown in Figures 1-3. Figure 1A shows that at 12 weeks, the %
lesion area is lower in the treated (dark bar) versus untreated (white bars) group. Thus there is
a decrease in plaque present in the thoracic aorta of treated versus untreated subjects. Figure

1B is a photograph of lesions on the vehicle only aorta versus the treated aorta. As shown in
the bar graph in Figure 2, the level of thoracic aorta plaque cholesterol content (TC    = total
cholesterol; FC  = free cholesterol and CE   = cholesterol ester) is lower in the treated (dark
bars) versus untreated (vehicle, white bars) group at 12 weeks. Figure 3 shows that, at 12
weeks, mean lesion area is lower in the treated group versus the untreated (vehicle) group.
Accordingly, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for
decreasing the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in both the aorta and aortic root, and for
decreasing the plaque cholesterol content. Thus, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
disclosure are useful for treating or preveing atherosclerosis and related signs, symptoms and
complications of atherosclerosis.
Example 2. Effects of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides in Conjunction with Statins to
Protecting Against Atherosclerosis and Lower Cholesterol Levels in a Mouse Model
[0182]    The effects of aromatic-cationic peptides in protecting against atherosclerosis, in
conjunction with one or more statins, in a mouse model are investigated as follows.
[0183]    Mice are treated as described in Example 1. That is, Apoprotein E deficient mice as
described in Example 1 are used in the study. An initial total cholesterol measurement is
made on the mice, and the mice are grouped into groups of 15 to match the total cholesterol
measurements. The groups are fed a "western diet" (40 kcal% butterfat, 0.15% [wt/wt]
cholesterol). Starting at t = 0, the control group of 15 mice receive vehicle only, while the
test groups of 15 mice receive aromatic-cationic peptide and one or more statins. Body
weights of the mice is recorded weekly, and mortality checks are performed daily.
[0184]    The aromatic-cationic peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (sterile lyophilized
powder) is tested. Each group of test mice receives a single, daily dose of the peptide,
subcutaneously at 1, 3, 5 or 10 mg/kg, and also receives, simultaneously atorvastatin,
fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin at 0.1, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 mg/kg. Control mice
receive vehicle only. The injections continue for 12 weeks, at which time the mice are
sacrificed and analyzed as described in Example 1.
[0185]     Plasma lipid analysis using an autoanalyzer include an evaluation of total
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (Trigs), phospholipids (PL), free cholesterol (FC), and
cholesterol ester (CE, by calculation). Gel electrophoresis is used to measure levels of high
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and
                                                 60

    WO 2014/022551                                                            PCT/US2013/053007
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). Histopathology/histomorphometery is
performed as described above in Example 1.
[0186]    Results: It is anticipated that mice receiving both the peptide and the statin will
show decreased levels of total cholesterol, free cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid,
cholesterol ester, LDL-C and VLDL-C as well as a decrease in the lesions as compared to
subjects receiving vehicle only. It is also anticipated that in some instances, subjects
receiving the combination treatment (aromatic-cationic peptide plus statin) will exhibit a
synergy between the two drugs, such that a lower dose of peptide, the statin or both will
achieve desired results, e.g., lowered levels of total cholesterol, free cholesterol, triglyceride,
phospholipid, cholesterol ester, LDL-C and VLDL-C and/or lesions.
[0187]    Accordingly, it is anticipated that the results will further demonstrate that the
aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure, alone or in combination with one or
more statins, will be useful for treating atherosclerosis, and signs, symptoms or complications
of atherosclerosis, including but not limited to increased total cholesterol, free cholesterol,
triglyceride, phospholipid, cholesterol ester, LDL-C and VLDL-C and increased
atherosclerotic lesions.
Example 3. Aromatic-cationic peptides increase coenzyme 010 levels
[0188]    Fibroblasts were treated with an aromatic-cationic peptide of the present disclosure,
and levels of coenzyme Q10 were evaluated.
[0189]    Fibroblasts were culture by methods known in the art, and treated with the aromatic
cationic peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 as shown in Table 11 below. Data represents
the average n = 3-6.

[0190]     Coenzyme QI levels were evaluated by methods known in the art.
[0191]     Results are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, exposure to the aromatic
cationic peptides of the present disclosure increased coenzyme Q10 levels in fibroblast cells.
Accordingly, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are usful for increasing
coenzyme QI levels in subjects in need thereof. For example, the aromatic-cationic
peptides of the present disclosure are useful for increasing coenzyme Q10 levels in subjects
taking one or more statin drugs and/or in subjects suffering from a disease or conditions
characterized by, or caused by low (e.g., below normal or control levels) coenzyme Q10
levels. The aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful to treat, prevent or
ameliorate the signs and/or symptoms of diseases or conditions characterized by low (e.g.,
below normal or control levels) coenzyme Q10 levels.

20.    The method of claim 15, wherein the peptide and the antihyperlipidemic drug are
       administered simultaneously.
21.    The method of claim 15, wherein the peptide and the antihyperlipidemic drug are
       administered sequentially in either order.
22.    The method of claim 15, wherein ameliorating the signs, symptoms or complications
       of atherosclerosis includes decreasing the size or number of atherosclerotic plaques in
       the subject, and/or decreasing the cholesterol content of an atherosclerotic plaque in
       the subject.
23.    A method for delaying onset, ameliorating or eliminating statin side effects in a
       subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering simultaneously,
       separately or sequentially with the statin, an effective amount of a peptide D-Arg-2'6'
       Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
24.    The method of claim 23, wherein the statin side effect includes one or more of
       myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, diabetes, memory loss, decreased
       coenzyme Q10 levels and mitochondrial dysfunction.
25.    The method of claim 23, wherein the statin is selected from the group consisting of:
       atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin,
       ADVICOR@ (niacin extended-release/lovastatin), ALTOPREV@ (lovastatin
       extended-release), CADUET@ (amlodipine and atorvastatin), CRESTOR@
       (rosuvastatin), JUVISYNC@ (sitagliptin/simvastatin), LESCOL@ (fluvastatin),
       LESCOL XL (fluvastatin extended-release), LIPITOR@ (atorvastatin), LIVALO@
       (pitavastatin), MEVACOR@ (lovastatin), PRAVACHOL@ (pravastatin), SIMCOR@
       (niacin extended-release/simvastatin), VYTORIN@ (ezetimibe/simvastatin), and
       ZOCOR@ (simvastatin).
26.    A method for increasing statin dosage in a subject in need thereof comprising:
       administering an effective amount of a statin at a first dosage level, and an aromatic
       cationic peptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;
       evaluating the subject for side-effects characteristic of the statin, wherein the side
       effects in the subject are reduced or absent as compared to a control subject
       administered the statin and not the aromatic cationic peptide;
                                                67

    WO 2014/022551                                                       PCT/US2013/053007
       administering a statin at a second dosage level, wherein the second dosage level is
       higher than the first statin dosage level.
27.    The method of claim 26, wherein the peptide is D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 .
28.    The method of claim 26, wherein the statin comprises LIPITOR@ or CRESTOR@.
29.    The method of claims 26, wherein the side effect characteristic of the statin includes
       one or more of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, diabetes, memory loss,
       decreased coenzyme Q10 levels and mitochondrial dysfunction.
30.    The method of any one of claims 1-29, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salt
       comprises acetate salt or trifluoroacetate salt.
