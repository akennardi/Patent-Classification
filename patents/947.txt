      GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEED COMBINED WITH SPORE FORMING
             BACTERIUM AND OPTIONAL INSECT CONTROL AGENTS
                                         Abstract
Products are provided that improve overall plant vigor and yield by combining
agriculturally effective amounts of at least one spore-forming bacterium and at least
one optional insect control agent to a genetically modified plant, plant part, or seed.
This product is particularly effective in the presence of plant parasitic nematode and
fungal species.     Use of the product leads to an overall reduction in crop losses
caused by either plant parasitic nematodes or fungi and this reduction is much
greater than using genetically modified seed with just an insect control agent.
According to some embodiments, the use of the product results in about a 2% - 10%
increase in soybean bushel yield, 3% - 6.5% increase in cotton yield, and 3% - 8% in
corn bushel yield. Methods for utilizing and manufacturing the combination are also
provided.

  GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEED COMBINED WITH SPORE FORMING
        BACTERIUM AND OPTIONAL INSECT CONTROL AGENTS
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001]      The invention relates generally to products and methods for reducing
overall damage and losses in plant health, vigor, and yield caused by plant parasitic
nematode and fungi. More specifically, the invention relates to products comprising
genetically modified seed and at least one agriculturally beneficial spore-forming
bacterium combined with an optional insect control agent, and methods for utilizing
the combination for treating genetically modified seeds, plants and plant parts.
Description of Related Art
[0002]      Nematodes are microscopic unsegmented worms known to reside in
virtually every type of environment (terrestrial, freshwater, marine). Of the over
80,000 known species, many are agriculturally significant, particularly those
classified as pests. One such species is the root knot nematode which attacks a
broad range of plants, shrubs, and crops. These soil-born nematodes attack newly
formed roots causing stunted growth, swelling or gall formation. The roots may then
crack open thus exposing the roots to other microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi. With environmentally friendly practices such as reduced or no tillage farming,
and various nematode species acquiring resistance to transgenic seed, nematode
related crop losses appear to be on the rise.
[0003]      Chemical nematicides such as soil fumigants or non-fumigants have been
in use for many years to combat infestations. Such nematicides may require
repeated applications of synthetic chemicals to the ground prior to planting. Due to
their toxicity, chemical nematicides have come under scrutiny from the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and in some cases their use has been
limited or restricted by the EPA. As the use of traditional chemical nematicides such
as methyl-bromide and organophosphates continue to be phased out, a need for the
development of alternative treatment options has arisen. U.S. Patent No. 6,593,273
                                           1

WO 2010/030554                                                            PCT/US2009/055842
discloses treatment of transgenic corn seeds with pesticides to treat nematode
infestations.
[0004]       U.S. Patent No. 6,844,339 discloses using a neonicotinoid to control
nematodes. The preferred compounds in the '339 patent are nitroimino or
nitroguanidino compounds. The neonicotinoid can be applied to either the nematode
environment or plant material itself. WO/2007/149817 discloses combining a
biological control agent with a nematicide, such as avermectin, to enhance plant
protection against pests and pathogens. This combination, however, does not
address the toxicity of using certain chemical nematicides.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]       There remains a need for effective compositions and methods that use
environmentally friendly biological components and less toxic chemical nematicides,
but utilize them in such a manner that they can provide improved plant vigor and
yield without the use of more toxic traditional chemical nematicides.
[0006]       The invention provides improved products and methods for controlling
nematode damage or infestations. The product uses at least one spore forming
bacterium and an optional insect control agent an optional fungicide control agent in
combination with a genetically modified seed, plant, or plant part.
[0007]       Methods for treating a seed, plant and/or plant part are also provided. The
method comprises (a) providing a composition comprising an effective amount of at
least one spore-forming bacterium; (b) combining the spore-forming bacterium with
an optional insect control agent; and (c) applying the composition to the genetically
modified seed, plant, and/or plant part. Application can be done in any desired
manner, such as in the form of seed coating, soil drench, and/or directly in-furrow
and/or as a foliar spray and applied either pre-emergence, post-emergence or both.
Optionally, the insect control agent can be applied separately to the genetically
modified seed, plant, or plant part. Further, at least one fungicide may also be
combined with the spore-forming bacterium, optional insect control agent, or applied
separately to the genetically modified plant, seed, or plant part. In sum, the
individual components or composition can be applied to the seed, the plant, the plant
foliar, to the fruit of the plant, or the soil wherein the plant is growing or wherein it is
desired to grow.

WO 2010/030554                                                         PCT/US2009/055842
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0014]       The products disclosed herein have been found to provide a greater
degree of plant vigor and yield in nematode infested environments than would be
expected from the application of insecticides to genetically modified seeds, plants,
and plant parts. At least some of the optional insect control agents have been
shown to provide increased root mass even in the absence of insect pressure which
increased root mass leads to improved establishment of the beneficial bacteria within
the rhizosphere which, in turn, reduces overall losses in crop vigor and yields caused
by either plant parasitic nematodes or fungi. Along with the physical combination of
these components while treating plants and plant parts, the compositions may be
formulated to provide a stable environment for living spore-forming bacteriums such
as spore-forming, root-colonizing bacteria. Various additives, such as fungicides,
insecticides, stabilizers, emulsifiers, may be added to the spore-forming bacterium
and /or genetically modified seed, plant, or plant part depending on the desired
properties.
[0015]       The genetically modified seeds, plants, or plant parts are typically
developed for insect control and herbicide tolerance. Thus, the addition of utilizing a
spore forming bacterium with the optional insect control agent helps complete the
ability of the seed to survive under adverse conditions. The at least one spore
forming bacterium generally has proven agriculturally beneficial to colonize a plant's
root system. The optional insect control agent can be at least one chemical
insecticide that, whether or not having proven direct nematicidal or fungicidal activity,
does possess the proven ability to increase the mass of the plant's root system to
which it is applied. The genetically modified seed can be any seed that results in a
genetically modified plant or plant part that expresses insect toxins or herbicide
resistance. Further, the genetically modified seed can be any seed that results in a
genetically modified plant or plant part that expresses toxins or resistance to
bacterial and fungi. Moreover, the genetically modified seed may be any seed that
results in a genetically modified plant or plant part that expresses tolerance to
environmental factors such as water stress and nitrogen production.

to obtain transgenic plants with resistance to such pests as black cutworms,
armyworms, and borers. Further, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,625,136 and 5,859,336, hereby
incorporated by reference in their entirety, disclose transforming corn plants with a
gene from B. thuringiensis that encodes for delta-endotoxins proving the transgenic
corn with improved resistance to European corn borers. A comprehensive report of
field trials of transgenic corn that expresses an insecticidal protein from B.
thuringiensis has been provided by Armstrong et al., in Crop Science, 35(2):550-557
(1995), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Additional references that
disclose corn encoded with the B. thuringiensis gene, include U.S. Patent Nos.

entirety; and WO 99/312248, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 Regarding herbicide resistance, U.S. Patent No. 4,971,908, herein incorporated by
 reference in its entirety, discloses genetically modified plants that are glyphosate
 resistant. Glyphosate resistance is achieved by genetically modifying the plant or
seed to produce mutant EPSP synthase enzymes that exhibit a lower affinity for
glyphosate while maintaining catalytic activity. Additional references that disclose
glyphosate resistant plants and seeds include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,463,175;

[0033]     The methods disclosed herein have been found to provide a greater
degree of plant vigor and yield in nematode infested environments than would be
expected from the application of insecticides alone to genetically modified seeds,
plants, or plant parts. Various additives, such as fungicides, insecticides, stabilizers,
emulsifiers, may be applied to the genetically modified seed or plant depending on
the desired properties.
[0034]     The methods include applying at least one spore-forming bacterium
combined with an optional insect control agent, and optional fungicide control agent,
to a genetically modified seed, plant, or plant part. Preferably, the spore-forming
bacterium is in solution form, emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powders,
suspension concentrate, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion
concentrate, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and
fine control release capsules in polymeric substances. Preferably, the insect control
agent, if present, is mixed with the spore forming bacterium, and applied
                                            11

WO 2010/030554                                                           PCT/US2009/055842
simultaneously with the spore forming bacterium. Optionally, the insect control agent
can be applied separately to the seed, plant, or plant part. Further, if a fungicide
control agent is present, this may be combined with the spore-forming bacterium /
insect control agent, or applied separately. If the spore-forming bacterium and insect
control agent are in powder form, they may be applied directly to the soil, seed, or
foliar separately or mixed together at the time of use. If in liquid form, the spore
forming bacterium and insect control agent, may be sprayed or atomized foliarly or
in-furrow at the time of planting, either separately or mixed together at the time of
treating. Alternatively, the liquid combination can be introduced to the soil before
germination of the seed or directly to the soil in contact with the roots by utilizing a
variety of techniques included, but not limited to, drip irrigation, sprinklers, soil
injection or soil drenching. Preferably, the liquid is applied to the seed before
planting.
[0035]      Depending on the final formulation and method of application, one or more
suitable additives can also be introduced to the spore-forming bacterium and
combinations thereof. Additives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and
synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules, or latexes, such as gum Arabic,
chitin, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such
as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be added to the present
compositions.
[0036]      In a preferred embodiment, the spore-forming bacterium, optional insect
control agent, and optional fungicide control agent, are formulated in a single, stable
solution, or emulsion or suspension. For solutions, the active chemical compounds
(insect control agents and optional fungicide control agent) are dissolved in solvents
before adding the spore- forming bacterium. Suitable liquid solvents include
petroleum based aromatics, such as xylene, toluene, or alkylnapthalenes, aliphatic
hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions,
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers
and esters, ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or
cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl
sulphoxide. For emulsions and suspensions, the liquid medium or solvent is water.
The spore-forming bacterium, optional insect control agent, and optional fungicide
control agent may be suspended in separate liquids and mixed at the time of
application. Preferably, the spore forming bacterium, optional insect control agent,
                                            12

WO 2010/030554                                                         PCT/US2009/055842
and optional fungicide control agent, are combined in a ready to use formulation that
exhibits a shelf-life of preferably two years. In use, the liquid can be sprayed or
atomized foliarly or in-furrow at the time of planting the corp. The liquid composition
can be introduced to the soil before germination of the seed or directly to the soil in
contact with the roots by utilizing a variety of techniques including, but not limited to,
drip irrigation, sprinklers, soil injection or soil drenching.
[0037]       Optionally, stabilizers and buffers can be added, including alkaline and
alkaline earth metal salts and organic acids, such as citric acid and ascorbic acid,
inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuring acid. Biocides can also be
added and can included formaldehydes or formaldehyde-releasing agents and
derivatives of benzoic acid, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Further additives
include functional agents capable of protecting seeds from harmful effects of
selective herbicides such as activated carbon, nutrients (fertilizers), and other agents
capable of improving the germination and quality of the products or a combination
thereof.
[0038]       Preferably, the spore-forming bacterium and optional insect control agents
are formulated as a liquid seed treatment. The seed treatment comprises at least
one spore forming bacterium, and at least one optional insect control agent.
Optionally, a fungicide control agent can be mixed with the spore-forming bacterium
and insect control agent. The seeds are substantially uniformly coated with one or
more layers of spore-forming bacterium, optional insect control agent, and optional
fungicide control agent, using conventional methods of mixing, spraying or a
combination thereof. Application is done using specifically designed and
manufactured equipment that accurately, safely, and efficiently applies seed
treatment products to seeds. Such equipment uses various types of coating
technology such as rotary coaters, drum coaters, fluidized bed techniques, spouted
beds, rotary mists or a combination thereof. Preferably, the application is done via
either a spinning "atomizer" disk or a spray nozzle which evenly distributes the seed
treatment onto the seed as it moves through the spray pattern. Preferably, the seed
is then mixed or tumbled for an additional period of time to achieve additional
treatment distribution and drying. The seeds can be primed or unprimed before
coating with the inventive compositions to increase the uniformity of germination and
emergence. In an alternative embodiment, a dry powder composition can be
metered onto the moving seed.
                                                13

WO 2010/030554                                                       PCT/US2009/055842
[0039]     The seeds may be coated via a continuous or batch coating process. In a
continuous coating process, continuous flow equipment simultaneously meters both
the seed flow and the seed treatment products. A slide gate, cone and orifice, seed
wheel, or weight device (belt or diverter) regulates seed flow. Once the seed flow
rate through treating equipment is determined, the flow rate of the seed treatment is
calibrated to the seed flow rate in order to deliver the desired dose to the seed as it
flows through the seed treating equipment. Additionally, a computer system may
monitor the seed input to the coating machine, thereby maintaining a constant flow of
the appropriate amount of seed.
[0040]      In a batch coating process, batch treating equipment weighs out a
prescribed amount of seed and places the seed into a closed treating chamber or
bowl where the corresponding of seed treatment is then applied. The seed and seed
treatment are then mixed to achieve a substantially uniform coating on each seed.
This batch is then dumped out of the treating chamber in preparation for the
treatment of the next batch. With computer control systems, this batch process is
automated enabling it to continuously repeat the batch treating process.
[0041]      In either coating process, the seed coating machinery can optionally be
operated by a programmable logic controller that allows various equipment to be
started and stopped without employee intervention. The components of this system
are commercially available through several sources such as Gustafson Equipment of
Shakopee, MN.
[0042]     A variety of additives can be added to the seed treatments. Binders can
be added and include those composed preferably of an adhesive polymer that can
be natural or synthetic without phytotoxic effect on the seed to be coated. A variety
of colorants may be employed, including organic chromophores classified as nitroso,
nitro, azo, including monoazo, bisazo, and polyazo, diphenylmethane,
triarylmethane, xanthene, methane, acridine, thiazole, thiazine, indamine,
indophenol, azine, oxazine, anthraquinone, and phthalocyanine. Other additives that
can be added include trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron,
copper, cobalt, molybdenum, and zinc. A polymer or other dust control agent can be
applied to retain the treatment on the seed surface.
[0043]     Other conventional seed treatment additives include, but are not limited to,
coating agents, wetting agents, buffering agents, and polysaccharides. At least one
agriculturally acceptable carrier can be added to the seed treatment formulation such
                                            14

WO 2010/030554                                                          PCT/US2009/055842
as water, solids or dry powders. The dry powders can be derived from a variety of
materials such as wood barks, calcium carbonate, gypsum, vermiculite, talc, humus,
activated charcoal, and various phosphorous compounds.
[0044]      In one embodiment, the seed coating can comprise of at least one filler,
which is an organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic component with which the
active components are combined to facilitate its application onto the seed.
Preferably, the filler is an inert solid such as clays, natural or synthetic silicates,
silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), natural soil
minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, lime, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite,
bentonite, or diatomaceous earths, or synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina, or
silicates, in particular aluminum or magnesium silicates.
[0045]      The spore-forming bacterium, optional insect control agent and optional
fungicide control agent, can be combined with any genetically modified plant seed
capable of germinating to form a plant or plant part that is susceptible to attack by
nematodes and/or pathogenic fungi or bacteria. The genetically modified seed can
be any seed that results in a genetically modified plant or plant part that expresses
insect toxins or herbicide resistance. Further, the genetically modified seed can be
any seed that results in a genetically modified plant or plant part that expresses
toxins or resistance to bacterial and fungi. Moreover, the genetically modified seed
may be any seed that results in a genetically modified plant or plant part that
expresses tolerance to environmental factors such as water stress and nitrogen
production. Suitable genetically modified seeds include those of cole crops,
vegetables, fruits, trees, fiber crops, oil crops, tuber crops, coffee, flowers, legume,
cereals, as well as other plants of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
species. Preferably, the genetically modified seeds include peanut, tobacco,
grasses, wheat, barley, rye, sorghum, rice, rapeseed, sugarbeet, sunflower, tomato,
pepper, bean, lettuce, potato, and carrot. Most preferably, the genetically modified
seeds include cotton, soybean, and corn (sweet, field, seed, or popcorn).

[0046]      Advantages of the novel combination of spore-forming bacterium and
genetically modified seed will be apparent from the non-limiting examples below.
The following examples demonstrate unexpected improvements in overall plant crop
yield by combining the spore-forming bacterium with an insect control agent and
applying the combination to genetically modified seeds.
Examples
                                       Example 1
[0047]      Example 1 shows the crop yield results under nematode pressure for the
combination of spore-forming bacterium and insect control agent applied to
genetically modified seed (control  + spore forming bacterium) compared to
genetically modified seed with just an insect control agent (control). The genetically
modified seeds in this comparison experiment were sourced from DELTA AND PINE
LAND® available from Monsanto, which are cotton seeds that contains both
glyphosate tolerance (Round-up Ready® trait) and insect tolerance (Bt gene) gene
expressions. The insecticide was imidacloprid (Gaucho Grande) or imidacloprid &
thiodicarb (AERIS®). The spore-forming bacterium was B. firmus. The nematode
type varied from none, root knot nematode, reiniform nematode, and lance
nematode. The concentration of insect control agents was 600 gm ai/liter, and in
liquid form. The application rate of the insect control agents was 500 - 1000 gm
ai/100 kg. The concentration of B. firmus ranged from 100,000 to 10,000,000 colony
forming units per seed. The insect control agent and B. firmus were mixed together
in an aqueous suspension in enough volume to adequately cover the cottonseed.
The rate of the mixture varied from 1369 - 2608 ml per 100kg of seed to assure
adequate coverage of the various seed sizes. Once planted, the cotton seed grew to
full maturity and the results measured in pounds of cotton per acre. The below table
compares the pounds of cotton per acre between the control and the control plus
spore forming bacterium at various nematode types. The yield difference numbers
represent an average of several experimental results, unless otherwise indicated.

        Some of the negative yield values are the result of uncontrollable
environmental and planting issues. Regarding Experiment Number 3, the negative
value may be attributable to low planting numbers from planter error, which will effect
overall crop yield. For Experiment No. 6, no replicates were done because of
damage to the planting plots.

increases were obtained. Regarding soybean seed, the addition of spore-forming
bacterium to NORTHUP KING TM soybean seed, PIONEER® soybean seed, and
soybean seed from Stine Seed Company showed about a 2% increase, 5% - 10%
increase, and 4.3% increase, respectively, in soybean bushel yield. This
improvement, spread out over several hundred acres results in a significant
improvement in crop yield. Regarding cotton seed, the addition of spore-forming
bacterium to DELTA AND PINE LAND* cotton seed and FIBERMAX® cotton seed
showed about a 3% increase and 6.5% increase, respectively, in pounds of cotton
per acre. Again, spreading this improvement over several hundred acres of cotton
plant yields a drastic improvement in yield. Regarding corn seed, the addition of
                                           25

spore-forming bacterium to corn seed from Burrus Seed Company and unknown
commercially available corn seed showed about a 3.2% increase and 8% increase,
respectively, in bushels of corn per acre. Again, this results in a huge improvement
in overall crop yield when spread out over several hundred acres. Overall, there is a
surprising advantage in crop yield when using the combination of spore-forming
bacterium and insect control agent with genetically modified seeds.
