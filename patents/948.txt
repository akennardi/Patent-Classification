   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
10 This invention relates to peptides capable of inhibiting the activity of the Proteinase
   Activated Receptor-2, PAR-2 and cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions which contain
   said peptides and their use in the treatment and/or care of conditions, disorders and/or
   diseases which improve or are prevented by the inhibition of PAR-2 activity.
15 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Proteases participate in a great variety of biological processes, from the digestion of
   proteins in the diet in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to controlling the cell cycle. An
   important role of proteases is their participation in signal transduction processes, whether
   this is by proteolytically cutting ligands or cell surface receptors to generate active ligands,
20 or, on the contrary, to degrade and inactivate agonists of certain receptors. One type of
   these cell surface receptors which are attacked by the proteases generating active ligands
   is the family of protease-activated G protein-coupled receptors, PAR (proteinase-activated
   receptors), for which a protease cuts in a specific place on the extracellular N-terminal
   domain of the receptor, and this cut means that a new N-terminal domain is exposed which
25 acts as an anchored ligand, bringing about the beginning of the signal transduction
   [Hollenberg M.D., "Physiology and pathophisiology of Proteinase Activated Receptors
   (PARs): proteinases as hormone-like signal messengers: PARs and more", (2005), J.
   Pharmacol. Sci., 97, 8-13]. The family of PARs has four members, PAR-1 to PAR-4, which
   are activated by a large number of proteases, such as coagulation cascade proteases
30 such as thrombin or the TF-FVlla-FXa complex, inflammatory cell proteases such as mast
                                                     2

   cell proteases (tryptase) and leucocytes (cathepsin G, elastase and proteinase-3),
   digestive tract proteases such as trypsins and pancreatic and extrapancreatic
   trypsinogens, tissue proteases such as kallikreins, as well as non-mammalian proteases,
   such as bacterial proteases, fungi, mites or insects [Ossovskaya V.S. and Bunnet N.W.,
 5  "Protease-Activated Receptors-contribution to physiology and disease", (2004), Physiol.
   Rev., 84, 579-621]. There is a certain selectivity in PAR activation; thrombin, for example,
   can activate PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4 with varying degrees of intensity, but does not
   activate PAR-2, whilst trypsin and tryptase or mast cell proteases activate PAR-2.
   Specifically, PAR-2 is widely distributed in the human body, including the skin, the
10 gastrointestinal tract and the circulatory, respiratory and nervous systems, modulating
   different physiological functions such as coagulation, proliferation             and   survival,
   inflammation, neurotransmission and pain. In pathological conditions, such as hemostasis
   or inflammation, both an overexpression of PAR-2 has been observed [Nystedt S. et al.
    "The Proteinase-activated Receptor 2 is induced by inflammatory mediators in human
15 endothelial cells. Comparison with the thrombin receptor", (1996), J. Biol. Chem.,
    1271(25), 14910-14915] as well as an overproduction of proteases capable of activating
   PAR-2.
   In the skin, PAR-2 is expressed abundantly in almost all cells types, especially in
   keratinocytes, and is particularly important in the stratum granulosum, which means its
20 expression can depend on the state of epidermal differentiation. In the stratum corneum
   there are three families of proteases; specific epidermal serine proteases such as
   kallikrein-5 (SCTE or stratum corneum tryptic enzyme) or kallikrein-7 (SCCE or stratum
   corneum chymotryptic enzyme), cysteine proteases such as cathepsins C, L, and V
   (stratum corneum thiol proteases), and at least one aspartate protease (cathepsin D). The
25 activity of these proteases is closely regulated by specific inhibitors and acts as a mediator
   of several cells responses in the skin, such as inflammation and immune responses,
   chemotaxis, cytokine expression, vascular function, tissue and apoptosis repair. As well
   as said endogenous proteases, signaling in the epidermis can also be due to some
   exogenous allergen proteases such as domestic mites, cockroaches, pollen, certain
30 bacteria and fungi. PAR-2 is a sensor for all these proteases, playing an important role in
   the maintenance of homeostasis of the barrier function of the skin. The participation of
   PAR-2 in homeostasis of the barrier function of the skin has been proven both in cell
   cultures and in animal models; the activation of PAR-2 in keratinocytes in culture inhibits
   cell proliferation, which is consistent with the delay in recovery of the barrier and inhibition
                                                   3

   of the secretion of lamellar bodies observed after the topical application of a PAR-2
   peptide agonist or allergens on the skin of mice, whilst an increase in the secretion of
   lamellar bodies and an accelerated recovery of the barrier function after the disruption to
   said barrier function has been observed in PAR-2 knockout mice, in comparison with their
 5 wild phenotype littermates [Derian C.K           et al., "Differential regulation of human
   keratinocyte growth and differentiation by a novel family of protease-activated receptors",
   (1997), Cell Growth Differ., 8(7), 743-749; Hachem J.-P. et al., "Serine protease signaling
   of epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis", (2006), J. Invest. Dermatol., 126(9), 2074
   2086; Jeong S.K et al., "Mite and cockroach allergens activate Protease-Activated
10 Receptor 2 and delay epidermal permeability barrier recovery", (2008), J. Invest.
   Dermatol., 128(8), 1930-1939].
   The abnormal expression or abnormal activity of proteases and, therefore, the
   overactivation of PAR-2 is associated with skin disorders or diseases such as atopic
   dermatitis, Netherton's syndrome, psoriasis and peeling skin syndrome [Komatsu N. etal.,
15  "Elevated human tissue kallikrein levels in the stratum corneum and serum of peeling skin
   syndrome-type B patients suggests an over-desquamation of corneocytes", (2006), J.
   Invest. Dermatol.,    126(10), 2338-2342]. Elevated levels of PAR-2 have also been
   described in skin inflammatory or immune diseases such as lichen planus, atopic
   dermatitis, psoriasis [Carvalho R.F. et al. "Increased mast cell expression of PAR-2 in
20 skin inflammatory diseases and release of IL-8 upon PAR-2 activation",(2010), Exp.
   Dermatol., 19(2), 117-122] or rosacea [Hachem J.-P. et aL., "Serine protease signaling of
   epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis", (2006), J. Invest. DermatoL., 126(9), 2074
   2086].
   PAR-2 is also involved in the development of inflammatory processes. Many of the cells
25 which orchestrate the response of the immune system during inflammation express PAR
   type receptors; for example eosinophilic infiltrates express PAR-2 [Miike S. et al., "Trypsin
   induces activation and inflammatory mediator release from human eosinophils through
   Protease-Activated Receptor-2", (2001), J. Immunol., 167(11), 6615-6622]. During the
   inflammatory processes potential endogenous PAR-2 activators are released, such as
30 leukocyte elastase, mast cell tryptase, proteinases of the trypsin family produced by
   keratinocytes and proteases of the fibrinolytic cascade such as factors FVlla or FXa.
   These components activate PAR-2 in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells
   and dermal sensory nerves to amplify inflammation by over-regulating inflammatory
   mediators. The activation of PAR-2 causes nitric oxide-dependant vasodilation [Saifeddine
                                                  4

   M. et al., "Rat Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR-2): cDNA sequence and activity of
   receptor-derived peptides in gastric and vascular tissue", (1996), Br. J. Pharmacol., 118,
   521-530; Sobey C.G. et al., 'Activation of Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PA R-2) elicits
   nitric oxide-dependent dilatation of the basilar artery in vivo", (1998), Stroke, 29(7), 1439
 5  1444], induces extravasation of plasma proteins and infiltration of neutrophils [Vergnolle
   N. et aL., "Characterization of the inflammatory response to Proteinase-Activated
   Receptor-2-activating peptides in the rat paw", (1999), Br. J. Pharmacol., 127(5), 1083
    1090; Kawabata A. et aL., "Increased vascular permeability by a specific agonist of
   Protease-Activated Receptor-2 in rat hindpaw", (1998), Br. J. Pharmacol., 125(3), 419
10 422], and stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [Hou L. et al.,
    "Immunolocalization of Protease-Activated Receptor-2 in skin: receptor activation
   stimulates interleukin-8 secretion by keratinocytes in vitro", (1998), Immunology, 94(3),
   356-362]. Furthermore, it has been described that in an animal model of contact
   hypersensitivity on mice ears, PAR-2 knockout mice show a reduction in the swelling of
15 ears and in the volume of inflammatory infiltrates, corroborating that PAR-2 plays a role
   as an inflammatory mediator in allergic dermatitis [Kawagoe J. et aL., "Effect of Protease
   Activated Receptor-2 deficiency on allergic dermatitis in the mouse ear", (2002), Jpn. J.
   Pharmacol., 88(1), 77-84]. It is also described that PAR-2 intervenes in the development
   of oral diseases and disorders such as periodontitis; the protease of the microorganism
20 Porphyromonas gingivalis presents PAR-2 in the active oral cavity and induces the
   secretion of IL-6, causing the infiltration of granulocytes in the gums and periodontitis
   through a mechanism which comprises the release of prostaglandin and the activation of
   matrix metalloproteinases with the consequential destruction of the collagen tissue
   supporting the teeth [Lourbakos A. et aL., "Arginine-specificprotease from Porphyromonas
25 gingivalis activates Protease-Activated Receptors on human oral epithelial cells and
   induces interleukin-6 secretion", (2001), Infect. Immun., 69(8), 5121-5130; Holzhausen
   M., Spolidorio L.C. and Vergnolle N.,         "Role of Protease-Activated Receptor-2 in
   inflammation, and its possible implications as a putative mediator of periodontitis", (2005),
   Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz., 100(1), 177-180].
30 Chronic inflammatory processes are also mediated by PAR-2, as is the case of rheumatoid
   arthritis. Activation of PAR-2 in a mouse's knee joint with PAR-2-activating peptides results
   in a swelling of the joint and hyperemia, clear indicators of inflammation. The duration of
   the inflammation and swelling can vary according to the nature of the PAR-2-activating
   peptide. At the same time, an increase in the expression of PAR-2 in the inflamed
35 synovium is detected, as well as in adjacent muscle and skin, presumably by discharge of
                                                  5

   adjuvant into said tissues during induction, this indicating that the increase in PAR-2
   expression is associated with chronic inflammatory responses in different types of tissue.
   However, mutant PAR-2 knockout mice are protected from arthritis induced by intra
   articular and peri-articular injections of CFA [Ferrell W.R. et al., "Essential role for
 5 Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 in arthritis", (2003), J. Clin. Invest., 111(1), 35-4 1; Kelso
   E.B. et al., "Therapeutic promise of Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 antagonism in joint
   inflammation", (2006), J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 316(3), 1017-1024].
   PAR-2 does not just participate in nociception, but also in the transmission of pain. The
   injection of sub-inflammatory doses of PAR-2-agonists in murinae induces hyperalgesia
10 sustained by mechanical and thermal stimuli, whilst this somatic hyperalgesia is absent in
   PAR-2 knockout animals [Vergnolle N. et al., "Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 and
   hyperalgesia: a novel pain pathway", (2001), Nat. Med., 7(7), 821-826]. The involvement
   of PAR-2 has also been described, and in particular in inflammatory pain, in visceral pain
   and pain due to cancer. For example, pancreatitis is associated with premature activation
15 of trypsinogen in the pancreas which induces hyperalgesia by a PAR-2-dependant
   mechanism [Hoogerwerf W.A. et al., "The Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 is involved in
   nociception", (2001), J. Neurosci., 21(22), 9036-9042] as well as visceral pain in different
   diseases of the digestive tract such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and
   Crohn's disease [Cenac N., "Role for protease activity in visceral pain in irritable bowel
20 syndrome", (2007), J. Clin. Invest., 117(3), 636-647]. In the same way, mechanical
   allodynia caused in cancerous processes disappears in PAR-2 knockout mice [Lam D.K.
   and Schmidt B.L., "Serine proteases and Protease-Activated Receptor-2-dependent
   allodynia: a novel cancer pain pathway", (2010), Pain, 149(2), 263-272]. The document
   WO 2009/117481 Al describes the use of PAR-2 activity inhibitors for the treatment of
25 chronic pain, inflammatory pain, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain, pain due to
   fractures, osteoporotic fractures, cancer or joint pain caused by gout, among others.
   PAR-2 notably contributes to neurogenic inflammation, as it is expressed in nociceptive
   peptidergic neurons of the peripheral system, which are responsible for this inflammation.
   During neurogenic inflammation, different endogenous serine proteases such as mast cell
30 tryptase and keratinocyte trypsin activate PAR-2 in sensory nerve ends to release a
   calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). These neuropeptides are
   pro-inflammatory: they induce vasodilatation, edema, and leukocyte recruitment, which
   results in neurogenic inflammation [Steinhoff M. et al. "Agonists of Proteinase-Activated
   Receptor-2 induce inflammation by a neurogenic mechanism", (2000), Nat. Med., 6(2),
                                                 6

    151-158].
   PAR-2 activation also mediates in the induction of itching [Shimada S.G., et al.,
    "Scratchingbehavior in mice induced by the Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 agonist,
   SLIGRL-NH2", (2006), Eur. J. Pharmacol., 530(3), 281-283], and this itching is
 5 independent of histamine. PAR-2 activation triggers the release of substance P, which, as
   well as causing itchiness, promotes the continued activation of mast cells via TRK
   receptors and the resulting release of tryptase, which in turn activates PAR-2 [Greaves
   M., "Recent advances in pathophysiology and current management of itch", (2007), Ann.
   Acad. Med. Singapore., 36(9), 788-792]. The levels of tryptase are abnormally high in
10 disorders or diseases of which involve itching, such as in atopic dermatitis, in which the
   concentrations of tryptase are up to four times higher than those observed in healthy skin
   [Steinhoff M. et aL., "Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 mediates itch: a novel pathway for
   pruritus in human skin", (2003), J. Neurosci., 23(15), 6176-6180]. It is described that PAR
   2 antagonists are capable of inhibiting trypsin-elicited scratching [Costa R. etal. "Evidence
15 for the role of neurogenic inflammation components in trypsin-elicited scratching
   behaviour in mice", (2008), Br. J. Pharmacol., 154(5), 1094-1103]. This property opens
   the door to the treatment of different conditions, disorders or diseases which involve itching
   through PAR-2 activity inhibitors, such as dermatitis, including contact dermatitis and
   atopic dermatitis, urticaria, food allergies or allergies to insect bites, among others.
20 PAR-2 sensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV-1), which belongs to
   the TRP channel superfamily, amplifying the response to pain, inflammation and itching
   [Amadesi S. et al., "Protease-Activated Receptor 2 Sensitizes the Capsaicin Receptor
    Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Receptor 1 to Induce Hyperalgesia", (2004), J.
   Neurosci., 24(18), 4300-4312; Dai Y. et aL, "Proteinase-Activated Receptor 2-Mediated
25 Potentiation of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Subfamily 1 Activity Reveals a
   Mechanism for Proteinase-Induced Inflammatory Pain", (2004), J. Neurosci., 24(18),
   4293-4299].
   PAR-2 is also expressed in neurons and astrocytes of the central nervous system in
   humans and rodents, and has been related to the pathogenesis associated with ischemia
30 and neurodegeneration [Smith-Swintowski V.L. et al., "Protease-Activated Receptor-2
   (PAR-2) is present in the rat hippocampus and is associated with neurodegeneration",
   (1997), J. Neurochem., 69(5), 1890-1896] as well as with the development of multiple
   sclerosis and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [Noorbakhsh F. etal.,
    "Proteinase-Activated     Receptor-2     modulates     neuroinflammation     in  experimental
                                                   7

   autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis", (2006), J. Exp. Med., 203(2), 425
   435].
   PAR-2 also plays an important role in regulating pigmentation. The exposure to UV
   radiation induces an overexposure of PAR-2 in keratinocytes [Scott G. et al., "Protease
 5 Activated Receptor-2, a receptor involved in melanosome transfer, is upregulated in
   human skin by ultraviolet irradiation", (2001), J. Invest. DermatoL, 117(6), 1412-1420],
   whose activation induces melanoma phagocytosis, which involves a transfer of
   melanocyte melanin to the keratinocyte with the resulting darkening of the epidermis
   [Seiberg M., "Keratinocyte-melanocyte interactions during melanosome transfer", (2001),
10 Pigment Cell Res., 14(4), 236-242]. Skin coloration has been a concern for human beings
   for many years. In particular, the capacity to eliminate hyperpigmentation, whether due to
   age (marks, freckles or the general aging of the skin), or due to disorders or diseases
   (melasma, chloasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) is of interest for individuals
   who want an even-looking skin complexion. Likewise, when exposure to UV radiation is
15 prolonged or excessive, cancerous hyperpigmented lesions or melanomas can develop
   [Dooley T.P., "Recent advances in cutaneous melanoma oncogenesis research", (1994),
   Onco. Res., 6, 1-9] as well as benign hyperpigmented marks due to photoaging. It is
   described that PAR-2 inhibition has a depigmenting effect on the skin [Seiberg M. et al.,
    "Inhibition of melanosome transfer results in skin lightening" (2000), J. Invest. Dermatol.,
20  115(2), 162-167], therefore the treatment of skin with PAR-2 activity inhibitors is a valid
   strategy to lessen skin pigmentation, as described in documents EP 0948308 B1, EP
   1077063 B1, US 6750229 B2 and EP 1139974 Al.
   However, the use of whitening or depigmenting compounds, whether for the treatment of
   hyperpigmented areas or areas close to hypopigmented areas, for aesthetic reasons to
25 lighten the natural skin color, its collateral effect is to increase the risk of damage by UV
   radiation, as they reduce the quantity of melanin produced by melanocytes. Melanin is the
   skin's natural photoprotector, as it clears, as heat, over 99.9% of UV radiation absorbed
   [Meredith P. et al., "Radiative relaxation quantum yields for synthetic eumelanin", (2004),
   Photochem. Photobiol., 79(2), 211-216]. This means that less than 0.1% of radiation
30 absorbed will be capable of generating free radicals, which cause direct and indirect DNA
   damage and, therefore, photoaging. The cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries
   compensate this lack of protection inherent in the use of whiteners or depigmenting agents
   with the addition of formulations of photoprotective substances or solar filters. Solar filters
   protect the skin from UVB radiation, which may cause burns, and from UVA radiation,
                                                   8

   which damages the skin on a more long-term scale by causing accelerated aging or
   photoaging. However, many of these substances are potentially irritating, sensitizing or
   toxic, their use being regulated and even limited or prohibited in different countries.
   Therefore, there is a need to develop whitening or depigmenting compounds with an
 5 intrinsic photoprotective effectiveness which enable the use of additional photoprotectors
   to be reduced.
   There is also expression of PAR-2 receptors in respiratory channels, in ciliated and non
   ciliated epithelial cells, as well as in glands, smooth muscle, vascular smooth muscle cells
   and endothelial cells [DAndrea M. et al., "Characterization of Protease-Activated
10 Receptor-2 immunoreactivity in normal human tissues", (1998), J. Histochem. Cytochem.,
   46(2), 157-164]. Said receptors are activated by endogenous proteases such as trypsin
   produced in the airway epithelial cells [Miki M. et al., "Effect of human airway trypsin-like
   protease on intracellular free Ca2 ' concentration in human bronchial epithelial cells",
   (2003), J. Med. Invest, 50(1-2), 95-107], or isolated tryptase in human pulmonary mast
15 cells [Berger P. et al., "Tryptase and agonists of PAR-2 induce the proliferation of human
   airway smooth muscle cells", (2001), J Appl Physiol., 91(3), 1372-1379], as well as by
   proteases of different allergens, such as cockroaches, mites such as Dermatophagoides
   pteronyssinus or mold [Sun G. et al., "Interaction of mite allergens Der P3 and Der P9 with
   Protease-Activated Receptor-2 expressed by lung epithelial cells", (2001), J. Immunol.,
20  167(2), 1014-1021; King C. et al., "Dust mite proteolytic allergens induce cytokine release
   from cultured airway epithelium", (1998), J Immunol., 161(7), 3645-3651; Page K. et al.,
    "Mucosal sensitization to German cockroach involves Protease-Activated Receptor-2",
   (2010), Respir. Res., 11(1), 62; Chiu L.L. et al., "Mold allergen, Pen c13, induced IL-8
   expression in human airway epithelial cells by activated Protease-Activated Receptor 1
25 and 2" (2007), J. Immunol., 178(8), 5237-5244].
   PAR-2 activation correlates with the mast cell infiltration observed in the allergic
   inflammation of airways; in PAR-2 knockout animal models there is a lesser infiltration of
   eosinophils in the event of allergic inflammation induced in airways, whilst the mutant
   which overexpresses PAR-2 presents an increase in this response [Schmidlin F. et al.,

   314]. PAR-2 activation gives rise to classic intracellular signals including the induction of
   an extensive repertoire of proangiogenic factors which facilitate the proliferation and
   migration of tumor cells; the inhibition of PAR-2 activity is therefore a useful strategy to
   restrict the growth of tumors and metastasis, as described in document US 2006/0104944

   and US 2006/0183664 Al among others. However, despite the arsenal of existing
                                                  10

   compounds and/or extracts, the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sector is still interested in
   developing alternatives to the compounds known in the prior art for the treatment and/or
   care of those conditions, disorders and/or diseases that improve or are prevented by the
   inhibition of PAR-2 activity.
 5
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   This invention provides a solution to the above-mentioned problem. Surprisingly the
   authors of this invention have found that the activity of PAR-2 can be inhibited by certain
   synthetic peptides. Said peptides are useful for the treatment and/or care of those
10 conditions, disorders and/or diseases which improve or are prevented by the inhibition of
   PAR-2 activity.
   Definitions
   In order to facilitate the comprehension of this invention, the meanings of some terms and
15 expressions as used in the context of the invention are included.
   In the context of this invention "skin" is understood to be the layers which comprise it, from
   the uppermost layer or stratum corneum to the lowermost layer or hypodermis, both
   inclusive. These layers are composed of different types of cells such as keratinocytes,
   fibroblasts, melanocytes, mast cells, neurons and/or adipocytes among others. The term
20 "skin" also includes the scalp.
   The term "treatment", as used in the context of this report, refers to the administration of
   a peptide according to the invention to alleviate or eliminate a disease or disorder or
   reduce or eliminate one or more symptoms associated with this disease or disorder. The
   term "treatment" also covers the ability to alleviate or eliminate the physiological
25 consequences of the disease or disorder.
   In the context of this invention "care" comprises the prevention of diseases and/or
   disorders.
   The term "prevention", as used in this invention, refers to the ability of a peptide in the
   invention to prevent, delay, or hinder the appearance or development of a disease or
30 disorder before its appearance.
                                                  11

   In the context of this invention, the term "aging" refers to the changes experienced by the
   skin with age (chronoaging) or through exposure to the sun (photoaging) or to
   environmental agents such as tobacco smoke, extreme climatic conditions of cold or wind,
   chemical contaminants or pollutants, and includes all the external visible and/or
 5 perceptible changes through touch, for example and not restricted to, the development of
   discontinuities on the skin such as wrinkles, fine lines, expression lines, stretch marks,
   striae, furrows, irregularities or roughness, increase in the size of pores, loss of hydration,
   loss of elasticity, loss of firmness, loss of smoothness, loss of the capacity to recover from
   deformation, loss of resilience, sagging of the skin such as sagging cheeks, the
10 appearance of bags under the eyes or the appearance of a double chin, among others,
   changes to the color of the skin such as marks, reddening, bags or the appearance of
   hyperpigmented areas such as age spots or freckles among others, anomalous
   differentiation, hyperkeratinization, elastosis, keratosis, hair loss, orange peel skin, loss of
   collagen structure and other histological changes of the stratum corneum, of the dermis,
15 epidermis,    vascular system       (for example the      appearance      of spider veins     or
   telangiectasias) or of those tissues close to the skin, among others. The term "photoaging"
   groups together the set of processes due to the prolonged exposure of the skin to
   ultraviolet radiation which result in the premature aging of the skin, and present the same
   physical characteristics as aging, for example and not restricted to, flaccidity, sagging,
20 changes to the color or irregularities in pigmentation, abnormal and/or excessive
   keratinization.
   In this description the abbreviations used for amino acids follow the recommendations of
   the IUPAC-IUB Commission of Biochemical Nomenclature specified in Eur. J. Biochem.,
   (1984), 138, 9-37.
25 Thus, for example, Ala represents NH2-CH(CH 3 )-COOH, Ala- represents NH2 -CH(CH 3)
   CO, -Ala represents -NH-CH(CH 3)-COOH and -Ala- represents -NH-CH(CH 3)-CO-.
   Therefore, the hyphen, which represents the peptide bond, eliminates the OH in the 1
   carboxyl group of the amino acid (represented here in the conventional non-ionized form)
   when situated to the right of the symbol, and eliminates the H of the 2-amino group of the
30 amino acid when situated to the left of the symbol; both modifications can be applied to
   the same symbol (see Table 1).

   fused, including, for example and not restricted to, phenyl, naphthyl, diphenyl, indenyl,
   phenanthryl or antranyl among others; or to an aralkyl group.
15 The term "aralkyl group" refers to an alkyl group substituted by an aromatic group, with
   between 7 and 24 carbon atoms and including, for example and not restricted
   to, -(CH 2)1.6-phenyl, -(CH 2 )1 .6 -(1 -naphthyl), -(CH 2)1.6-(2-naphthyl), -(CH 2)1.6-CH(phenyl) 2

   The term "heterocyclyl group" refers to a hydrocarbonated ring of 3-10 members, in which
20 one or more of the atoms of the ring, preferably 1, 2 or 3 of the atoms of the ring, is a
   different element to carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur and can be saturated or
   unsaturated. For the purposes of this invention, the heterocycle can be a cyclic,
   monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic system, which may include systems of fused rings; and the
   nitrogen, carbon or sulfur atoms in the heterocyclyl radical may be optionally oxidized; the
25 nitrogen atom may be optionally quaternized; and the heterocyclyl radical may be partially
   or completely saturated or be aromatic. The greatest preference is for the term
   heterocyclyl to refer to a ring of 5 or 6 members. Examples of saturated heterocyclyl
   groups are dioxane, piperidine, piperazine, pyrrolidine, morpholine and thiomorpholine.
   Examples of aromatic heterocyclyl groups, also known as heteroaromatic groups are
30 pyridine, pyrrol, furan, thiophene, benzofuran, imidazoline, quinolein, quinoline, pyridazine
   and naphthyridine.

   The peptides of this invention can exist as stereoisomers or mixtures of stereoisomers; for
   example, the amino acids which comprise them can have the configuration L-, D-, or be
   racemic independently of each other. Therefore, it is possible to obtain isomeric mixtures
   as well as racemic mixtures or diastereomeric mixtures, or pure diastereomers or
10 enantiomers, depending on the number of asymmetric carbons and on which isomers or
   isomeric mixtures are present. The preferred structures of the peptides of the invention
   are pure isomers, i.e., enantiomers or diastereomers.
   For example, when it is stated that AA1 can be -Ser-, it is understood that AA1 is selected
   from -L-Ser-, -D-Ser- or mixtures of both, racemic or non-racemic. The preparation
15 processes described in this document enable the person skilled in the art to obtain each
   of the stereoisomers of the peptide of the invention by choosing the amino acid with the
   right configuration.
   In the context of this invention, the term "amino acids" includes the amino acids codified
   by the genetic code as well as uncodified amino acids, whether they are natural or not.
20 Examples of non-codified amino acids are, without restriction, citrulline, ornithine,
   sarcosine,    desmosine,      norvaline,   4-aminobutyric    acid,  2-aminobutyric     acid,
   2-aminoisobutyric acid, 6-aminohexanoyc acid, 1-naphthylalanine, 2-naphthylalanine,

   In the context of this invention, when n, m, p or q are not 0 it is clearly understood that the
   nature of W, X, Y and/or Z does not hinder the activity of the peptides of the invention, but

20 Preparation processes of the peptides of the invention
   Synthesis of the peptides of the invention, their stereoisomers, mixtures thereof and/or
   their cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be carried out according to
   conventional methods, known in the prior art, such as using solid phase peptide synthesis
   methods [Stewart J.M. and Young J.D., "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd edition"
25 (1984), Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois; Bodanzsky M. and Bodanzsky A.,
    "The practice of Peptide Synthesis", (1994), Springer Verlag, Berlin; Lloyd-Williams P. et
   al., "Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins", (1997), CRC, Boca
   Raton, FL, USA], synthesis in solution, a combination of the methods of solid phase
   synthesis and synthesis in solution or enzymatic synthesis [Kullmann W. "Proteases as
30 catalysts for enzymic syntheses of opioid peptides", (1980), J.BioLChem., 255(17),
   8234-8238]. The peptides can also be obtained by fermentation of a bacterial strain,
                                                  29

   modified or unmodified, by genetic engineering to produce the desired sequences, or by
   controlled hydrolysis of proteins with animal or plant origins, preferably plant, which
   release peptide fragments which contain, at least, the desired sequence.
   For example, a method of obtaining the peptides (1)of the invention, their stereoisomers
 5 and mixtures thereof comprises the stages of:
         - coupling of an amino acid, with the N-terminal end protected and the C-terminal
            end free, with an amino acid with the N-terminal end free and the C-terminal end
            protected or bound to a solid carrier;
         - elimination of the protective group of the N-terminal end;
10        - repetition of the coupling sequence and elimination of the protective group of the
            N-terminal end until the desired peptide sequence is obtained;
          - elimination of the protective group of the C-terminal end or cleavage of the solid
            carrier.
   Preferably, the C-terminal end is bound to a solid carrier and the process is carried out in
15 solid phase and, therefore, comprises the coupling of an amino acid with the N-terminal
   end protected and the C-terminal end free with an amino acid with the N-terminal end free
   and the C-terminal end bound to a polymer carrier; elimination of the protective group of
   the N-terminal end; and repetition of this sequence as many times as is necessary to thus
   obtain the peptide of the desired length, finally followed by the cleavage of the synthesized
20 peptide of the original polymeric carrier.
   The functional groups of the side chains of the amino acids are maintained conveniently
   protected with temporary or permanent protective groups throughout synthesis, and can
   be unprotected simultaneously or orthogonally to the process of cleavage of the peptide
   of the polymeric carrier.
25 Alternatively, solid phase synthesis can be carried out using a convergent strategy
   coupling a peptide with the polymeric carrier or with an amino acid previously bound to the
   polymeric carrier. Convergent synthesis strategies are widely known by persons skilled in
   the art and are described in Lloyd-Williams P. et al., "Convergent Solid-Phase Peptide
   Synthesis", (1993), Tetrahedron, 49(48), 11065-11133.
30 The procedure can comprise the additional stages of deprotection of the N-terminal and
                                                  30

   C-terminal ends and/or cleavage of the peptide of the polymeric carrier in an indiscriminant
   order, using standard processes and conditions known in the prior art, after which the
   functional groups of these ends can be modified. The optional modification of the
   N-terminal and C-terminal ends can be carried out with the peptide of formula (1)anchored
 5 to the polymeric carrier or once the peptide has been separated from the polymeric carrier.
   Optionally, R1 can be introduced by the reaction of the N-terminal end of the peptide of the
   invention with a R1-X compound, wherein R1 has the aforementioned meaning and X is a
   leaving group, for example and not restricted to, the tosyl group, the mesyl group and
   halogen groups among others; through a nucleophilic substitution reaction, in the
10 presence of an adequate base and solvent, wherein the fragments that have the functional
   groups not involved in the N-C bond formation are suitably protected with temporary or
   permanent protective groups.
   Optionally and/or additionally, the R2 radicals can be introduced by the reaction of a
   compound HR2 wherein R2 is -OR 3 , -NR3 R4 or -SR 3 , with a complementary fragment which
15 corresponds to the peptide of formula (1)in which R2 is -OH in the presence of an adequate
   solvent and a base such as, NN-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) or triethylamine or an
   additive such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or 1-hydroxyazabenzotriazole (HOAt)
   and a dehydrating agent, such as a carbodiimide, a uronium salt, a phosphonium salt or
   amidinium salt, among others, or by prior formation of an acyl halide with, for example,
20 thionyl chloride, and thereby obtaining a peptide according to the invention of general
   formula (I), wherein the fragments that have the functional groups not involved in the N-C
   bond formation are suitably protected with temporary or permanent protective groups, or
   alternatively other R2 radicals may be introduced by simultaneous incorporation to the
   peptide cleavage process from the polymeric carrier.
25 A person skilled in the art would easily understand that the deprotection/cleavage steps of
   the C-terminal and N-terminal ends and their subsequent derivatization can be performed
   in a different order, according to the processes known in the prior art.
   The term "protective group" relates to a group which blocks an organic functional group
   and which can be removed in controlled conditions. The protective groups, their relative
30 reactivities and the conditions in which they remain inert are known to the person skilled
   in the art.

   amide acetate, amide benzoate, amide pivalate; carbamates such as benzyloxycarbonyl

   (Dmab) ester, among others; preferred protective groups of the invention are the All, tBu,
   cHex, Bzl and Trt esters.

15 process with temporary or permanent protective groups orthogonal to the protective
   groups of the N-terminal and C-terminal ends.

   2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl (Pmc). The indole group of the tryptophan side
   chain can be protected by the formyl group (For), Boc, Mts or be used unprotected. For
   the protection of the amino groups of the lysine and ornithine side chains amides can be
   used, such as amide acetate, amide benzoate, amide pivalate; carbamates, such as Cbz

   Cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention
   The peptides of the invention can be administered to inhibit PAR-2 activity by any means
   which causes contact between the peptides and the site of action in a mammal's body,
20 preferably that of a human being, and in the form of a composition which contains them.
   To this regard, another aspect of the invention is a cosmetic or pharmaceutical
   composition which comprises at least one peptide of general formula (1), its stereoisomers,
   mixtures thereof, and/or its cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable salts together with
   at least one cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant or excipient. These
25 compositions can be prepared by conventional means known to persons skilled in the art
   ["Harry's Cosmeticology", Seventh edition, (1982),          Wilkinson J.B., Moore R.J., ed.
   Longman House, Essex, GB].
   The peptides of this invention have variable solubility in water, according to the nature of
   their sequence or any possible modifications in the N-terminal and/or C-terminal ends.
30 Therefore, the peptides of this invention can be incorporated into the compositions by
   aqueous solution, and those which are not soluble in water can be solubilized in
   cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable conventional solvents such as and not
                                                    34

   restricted to, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, glycerine, butylene glycol
   or polyethylene glycol or any combination thereof.
   The cosmetically or pharmaceutically effective amount of the peptides of the invention
   which should be administered, as well as their dosage, will depend on numerous factors,
 5 including age, state of the patient, the nature or severity of the condition, disorder or
   disease to be treated and/or cared for, the route and frequency of administration and of
   the particular nature of the peptides to be used.
   "Cosmetically and pharmaceutically effective amount" is understood to mean a non-toxic
   but sufficient amount of the peptide or peptides of the invention to provide the desired
10 effect. The peptides of the invention are used in the cosmetic or pharmaceutical
   composition of this invention at cosmetically or pharmaceutically effective concentrations
   to achieve the desired effect; in a preferred form with regards to the total weight of the
   composition, between 0.00000001% (in weight) and 20% (in weight); preferably between
   0.000001% (in weight) and 15% (in weight), more preferably between 0.00001% (in
15 weight) and 10% (in weight) and even more preferably between 0.001% (in weight) and
   5% (in weight).
   The peptides of the invention or their functionally equivalent variants, their stereoisomers,
   mixtures thereof and/or their cosmetic or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, can also be
   incorporated into cosmetic or pharmaceutical delivery systems and/or sustained release
20 systems.
   The term "delivery systems" relates to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which
   the peptide of the invention is administered. These cosmetic or pharmaceutical carriers
   can be liquids, such as water, oils or surfactants, including those of petroleum, animal,
   plant or synthetic origin, for example and not restricted to, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral
25 oil, sesame oil, castor oil, polysorbates, sorbitan esters, ether sulfates, sulfates, betaines,
   glycosides, maltosides, fatty alcohols, nonoxynols, poloxamers, polyoxyethylenes,
   polyethylene glycols, dextrose, glycerol, digitonin and similar. A person skilled in the art
   knows the diluents, adjuvants or excipients which can be used in the different delivery
   systems in which the peptide of the invention can be administered.
30 The term "sustained release" is used in a conventional sense relating to a delivery system
   of a compound which provides the gradual release of this compound during a period of
   time and preferably, although not necessarily, with relatively constant compound release
   levels over a period of time.
                                                 35

   Examples of delivery or sustained release systems include, without restriction, liposomes,
   mixed liposomes, oleosomes, niosomes, ethosomes, milliparticles, microparticles,
   nanoparticles and solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, sponges,
   cyclodextrins, vesicles, micelles, mixed micelles of surfactants, surfactant-phospholipid
 5 mixed micelles, millispheres, microspheres and nanospheres, lipospheres, millicapsules,
   microcapsules and nanocapsules, as well as in microemulsions and nanoemulsions,
   which can be added to achieve a greater penetration of the active principle and/or improve
   its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Preferred delivery or sustained
   release systems are liposomes, surf actant-phospholipid mixed micelles, microemulsions,
10 more preferably water-in-oil microemulsions with an internal structure of reverse micelle
   and nanocapsules containing microemulsions.
   The sustained release systems can be prepared by methods known in the prior art, and
   the compositions which contain them can be administered, for example, by topical or
   transdermal administration, including adhesive patches, non-adhesive patches, occlusive
15 patches and microelectric patches, or by systemic administration, for example and not
   restricted to, oral or parenteral route, including nasal, rectal or subcutaneous implantation
   or injection, or direct implantation or injection into a specific body part, and preferably
   should release a relatively constant quantity of the peptides of the invention. The amount
   of peptide contained in the sustained release system will depend, for example, on where
20 the composition is to be administered, the kinetics and duration of the release of the
   peptide of the invention, as well as the nature of the condition, disorder and/or disease to
   be treated and/or cared for.
   The peptides of this invention can also be adsorbed on solid organic polymers or solid
   mineral supports such as and not restricted to, talc, bentonite, silica, starch or maltodextrin
25 among others.
   The compositions which contain the peptides of the invention, their stereoisomers,
   mixtures thereof and/or their cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable salts can also
   be incorporated into fabrics, non-woven fabrics and medical devices which are in direct
   contact with the skin, thus releasing the peptides of the invention whether by
30 biodegradation of the binding system to the fabric, non-woven fabric or medical device, or
   by friction between them and the body, due to body moisture, the skin's pH or body
   temperature. Furthermore, the peptides of the invention can be incorporated into the
   fabrics and non-woven fabrics used to make garments that are in direct contact with the
   body. Preferably, the fabrics, non-woven fabrics and medical devices containing the
                                                   36

   peptides of the invention are used for the treatment and/or care of conditions, disorders
   and/or diseases which improve or are prevented by in inhibition of PAR-2 activity.
   Examples of fabrics, non-woven fabrics, garments, medical devices and means for
   immobilizing the peptides to them, among which are the delivery systems and/or the
 5 sustained release systems described above, can be found in literature and are known in
   the prior art [Schaab CK. (1986)           HAPPI May 1986; Nelson G.,          "Application of
   microencapsulation in textiles", (2002), Int. J. Pharm., 242(1-2), 55-62; "Biofunctional

   Chemical Synthesis
   All synthetic processes were carried out in polypropylene syringes fitted with porous
   polyethylene discs. All the reagents and solvents were synthesis quality and were used
   without any additional treatment. The solvents and soluble reagents were removed by
20 suction. The Fmoc group was removed with piperidine-DMF (2:8, v/v) (1 x 1 min, 1 x 5
   min, 5 mL/g resin) [Lloyd-Williams P. et al., "Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of
   Peptides and Proteins", (1997), CRC, Boca Raton (FL, USA)]. Washes between stages of
   deprotection, coupling, and, again, deprotection, were carried out with DMF (3 x 1 min)
   each time using 10 mL solvent/g resin. Coupling reactions were performed with 3 mL
25 solvent/g resin. The control of the couplings was performed by carrying out the ninhydrin
   test [Kaiser E et al., "Color test for detection of free terminal amino groups in the solid
   phase synthesis of peptides", (1970), Anal. Biochem., 34(2), 595-598] or chloranil test
   [Christensen T., "A Qualitative Test for Monitoring Coupling Completeness in Solid Phase
   Peptide Synthesis Using Chloranil", (1979), Acta Chem. Scand., 33B, 763-766]. All

   EXAMPLE 8
   Inhibition of PAR-2 activity by the peptides of the invention.
   Human keratinocytes were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well
 5 in 100 pL of complete DMEM culture medium. After 48 hours, the medium was removed
   and the cells were incubated with 100 pL of a solution of the peptides of the invention at
   1 mg/mL for 1 hour at 37 2C in a C02 incubator. After the incubation, 100 pL of a mixture
   from the Fluo-4 NW (Invitrogen) fluorescent calcium probe and Probenecid was added to
   each well, prepared according to the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen), and the plate was
10 incubated for 30 min at 37 2C in a C02 incubator, after which PAR-2 was activated by
   treatment with 1 pg/mL of the PAR-2 agonist I (Calbiochem).
   The PAR-2 activity was determined by reading the fluorescence in a FLUOstar Galaxy
   reader (BMG LabTechnologies) using the 500 nm filters for the excitation and 520 nm for
   the emission, recording the fluorescence before and after PAR-2 activation. The
15 fluorescence measurements were corrected with regard to the corresponding background
   fluorescences for each measurement and were standardized with regard to the maximum
   fluorescence observed in the treatment with the PAR-2 agonist 1. The inhibition values of
   PAR-2 activity were calculated by comparing the maximum fluorescence corresponding
   to PAR-2 activation with agonist I and the values for each treatment. Table 3 details the
20 best inhibition values of PAR-2 activity obtained for the peptides of the invention.

   Inhibition of sensitization of TRPV1 mediated by PAR-2 activity in sensory neurons in
   culture. Determination of CGRP levels.
   PAR-2 activation induces sensitization of the transient receptor potential vanilloid
 5 subfamily 1 (TRPV-1) in peptidergic sensory neurons, resulting in an entry of Ca- which
   activates the intracellular signaling cascade and, concomitantly, leads to the release of
   pro-inflammatory peptides such as substance P (SP) and the a-calcitonin gene related
   peptide (CGRP), amplifying the response to pain, inflammation and itching [Dai Y. et al.,
    "Proteinase-Activated Receptor 2-Mediated Potentiation of Transient Receptor Potential
10  Vanilloid Subfamily 1 Activity Reveals a Mechanism for Proteinase-Induced Inflammatory
   Pain", (2004), J. Neurosci., 24(18), 4293-4299]. Thus, the effectiveness and potential of
   the peptides in the inhibition of a-CGRP release due to TRPV-1 sensitization mediated by
   PAR-2 activity in in culture of rat DRG neurons was evaluated.
   DRG neurons in culture were incubated with the different treatments at the indicated
15 concentrations in buffer medium HBSS (Hank's Balanced salt solution) for 15 min at 37 C,
   after which the neurons were sensitized by treatment with the PAR-2 agonist I at 30 pM
   for 15 min at 37 2C. Lastly a-CGRP release was induced by treatment with capsaicin 1 pM
   for 5 min at 37 2C. The supernatants were collected and the amount of a-CGRP released
   was determined by enzyme immunoassay using the Rat CGRP EIA kit (SPI-Bio, Societe
20 de Pharmacologie et d'Immunologie-BIO, France) following the supplier's instructions.
   The intensity of the color, determined by reading the absorbency at 405 nm, is proportional
   to the amount of CGRP released. The relative values of CGRP released were determined
   by double standardization with regard to the basal release of CGRP of the negative control
   (cells treated with HBSS) and the maximum releases of CGRP induced by the treatment
25 with the cells with the PAR-2 agonist I and capsaicin. Table 4 details the values of CGRP
   determined for the different treatments.

   Cell proliferation was evaluated by a fluorescence-based cell viability method, in which the
   live cells are distinguished from the dead cells by the enzymatic conversion of calcein-AM
10 to its fluorescent form.
   Human keratinocytes were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum
   (FBS) until confluence was achieved. The cells were then separated using trypsin and
   were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. After 24 hours of
   incubation in DMEM at 37 2C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO 2 a fresh medium was
15 added with different concentrations of the product of the invention. Cells treated with
   DMEM as a negative control were used. The cells were incubated for another 24 hours
   under the same conditions and the medium was substituted by 100 pl of calcein-AM
   (Molecular Probes) at 0.4 pM diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After 30 minutes
   of incubation at 37 LC the fluorescence was measured at excitation 485 nm and emission
20 530 nm in a plate reader (Genios, Tecan). The total growth percentage was calculated as
   T/C x 100 wherein T is the fluorescence of the wells treated with the peptides of the
   invention and C the fluorescence of the control wells treated with DMEM.

   Human keratinocytes were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum
   (FBS) until confluence was achieved. The cells were then separated using trypsin and
   were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells per well in 48-well plates. After 48 hours of
   incubation in DMEM at 37 2C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% C02 a cut in the cultivation
15 with a pipette point to create an area without cells simulating an injury and photographs
   were taken of said area with a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope equipped with a
   AxioCam MRc5 camera, calculating the area of the zone without cells using the (AO)
   equipment software. A fresh medium was then added with different concentrations of the
   product of the invention. Cells treated with DMEM as a negative control were used, and
20 cells treated with DMEM and FBS as the positive healing control. The cells were incubated
   for another 48 hours under the same conditions to enable cell migration in the injury area,
   after which photographs were taken of the injury area once again and the corresponding
   areas of the zones without cells were calculated (A48).
   The healing percentage was calculated as the ratio of the reduction to the area without
25 cells after 48 hours and the area without cells before incubation with the peptide [(AO
   A48)/AO]. Table 7 shows the healing values after incubation with the peptides of the
   invention at the stated concentrations.

   A study of the stinging induced by the application of capsaicin was carried out on 12
15 Caucasian volunteers between the ages of 20 and 45, selected with a degree of response
   in a Stinging test (subjective self-evaluation of the intensity of the stinging after the

   stinging). Throughout the duration of the study the subjects did not use different products
   on the areas tested and avoided exposure to UV radiation. The volunteers applied the
20 composition of Example 17 to one forearm and a placebo composition (the same

   EXAMPLE 24
   In vivo study of skin hydration.
   A comparative in vivo study of the hydrating capacity of the skin of the cosmetic
   composition in example 22 and its placebo composition, which contained the same
 5 ingredients and in the same percentages as the composition of example 22, except the
   peptide of the invention, Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Trp-L-Phe-L-His-L-Val-NH 2 , which was
   substituted by water.
   The measurements of this study were carried out after the test persons were acclimatized
   for 45 minutes in a bioclimatic room (22 2C; 60% relative humidity) and with the purpose
10 of maintaining the temperature and humidity constant during the measuring. The
   measurements of skin hydration were carried out on the legs using a Corneometer@ CM
   825 (Courage & Khazaka, Germany). Twenty women with an age between 18 and 55, with
   sensitive skin and itch sensation on their legs participated in the study; they were
   instructed not to apply any cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical composition other than
15 those used in the study during its duration, or 7 days prior to the beginning of the study.
   All the volunteers applied the placebo composition on their right leg and the cosmetic
   composition from Example 22 on their left legs twice a day for 4 weeks, always applying
   the placebo composition to the right leg and the composition from example 22 to the left
   leg. The volunteers did not apply any cosmetic composition for at least 10 hours before
20 undertaking the instrumental measurements. Skin measurement values were measured
   at three different places within the respective testing areas. The recorded values were
   averaged.
   The skin hydration measurements were taken before the beginning of the study and al
   and 4 weeks after the first application of the previous compositions.
25 Table 19 shows the averaged change of skin moisture with the cosmetic composition of
   example 22 in respect to the placebo composition calculated as [(averaged improvement
   of    composition    of   example      22)    -  (averaged     improvement     of    placebo
   composition)]/(averaged improvement of placebo composition)*1 00.

   The results in the table clearly show that the composition from example 22 has greater
   skin hydration power than the placebo composition, and therefore it is demonstrated that
 5 the   compound     Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Trp-L-Phe-L-His-L-Val-NH      2  improves     the   skin's
   hydration in vivo.
   EXAMPLE 25
   Anti-sensitizing potential of a cosmetic cream of Example 23 containing Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe
   L-Trp-L-Phe-L-His-L-Val-NH 2 in Reconstructed Human Epidermis (RHE).
10 Cosmetic creams containing parfums normally show allergic reactions due to some
   allergenic components like cinnamal or farnesol. The purpose of this experiment was to
   evaluate the anti-sensitizing potential of a cosmetic cream of Example 23 containing
   cinnamal,    farnesol  and    the peptide Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Trp-L-Phe-L-His-L-Val-NH 2,
   compared with a placebo cream (composition of Example 23 without the ingredients of
15 phase C). In order to determine the anti-sensitizing potential the level of interleukin-8, IL
   8 was measured for both creams in RHE tissues after 24 h of cream application.
   Commercial RHE tissues (SkinEthic, Lyon, RHE/S/1 7) (0.5 cm2 ) were treated in triplicate
   with 15 pg of the composition of Example 23 and the placebo composition over the surface
   of the tissue. After 24 hours of incubation in growth medium at 372C in a humidified
20 atmosphere at 5% C0 2 , the IL-8 expression in the treated RHE tissues was determined
   using the ELISA Interleukin detection kit (Invitrogen) following the supplier's instructions.
   The absorbance was determined by reading the spectrophotometer Synergy MX, Biotek,
   at 450 nm.

   versus the placebo composition, and therefore the peptide Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Trp-L-Phe
 5 L-His-L-Val-NH 2 proved to highly counteract the release of cytokines induced by cosmetic
   allergens such as cinnamal and farnesol.
