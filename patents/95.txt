     BOLAAMPHIPHILIC COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS AND USES THEREOF
                                               FIELD
[0001]          Provided herein are nanovesicles comprising bolaamphiphilic compounds, and
complexes thereof with biologically active molecules, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.
Also provided are methods of delivering biologically active molecules into the human brain and
animal brain using the compounds, complexes and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0002]          Many drugs and biologically active molecules cannot penetrate the BBB and thus
require direct administration into the CNS tissue or the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in order to
achieve a biological or therapeutic effect. Even direct administration into a particular CNS site is
often limited due to poor diffusion of the active agent because of local absorption/adsorption into
the CNS matrix. Present modalities for drug delivery through the BBB entail disruption of the
BBB by, for example, osmotic means (hyperosmotic solutions) or biochemical means (e.g., use
of vasoactive substances such as. bradykinin), processes with serious side effects.
[0003]          The brain is a highly specialized organ, and its sensitive components and
functioning are protected by a barrier known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The brain
capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) that form the BBB play important role in brain physiology by
maintaining selective permeability and preventing passage of various compounds from the blood
into the brain. One consequence of the highly effective barrier properties of the BBB is the
limited penetration of therapeutic agents into the brain, which makes treatment of many brain
diseases extremely challenging.
[0004]          Efforts to improve the permeation of biologically active compounds across the
BBB using amphphilic vesicles have been attempted.
[0005]          For example, complexation of the anionic carboxyfluorescein (CF) with single
headed amphiphiles of opposite charge in cationic vesicles, formed by mixing single-tailed
cationic and anionic surfactants has been reported (Danoff et al. 2007).
[0006]          Furthermore, WO 02/055011 and WO 03/047499, both of the same applicant,
disclose amphiphilic derivatives composed of at least one fatty acid chain derived from natural
vegetable oils such as vernonia oil, lesquerella oil and castor oil, in which functional groups such
as epoxy, hydroxy and double bonds were modified into polar and ionic headgroups.

 WO 2014/039504                                                             PCT/US2013/057960
[0007]          Additionally, WO 10/128504 reports a series of amphiphiles and bolamphiphiles
(amphiphiles with two head groups) useful for targeted drug delivery of insulin, insulin analogs,
TNF, GDNF, DNA, RNA (including siRNA), enkephalin class of analgesics, and others.
[0008]          These synthetic bolaamphiphiles (bolas) have recently been shown to form
nanovesicles that interact with and encapsulate a variety of small and large molecules including
peptides, proteins and plasmid DNAs delivering them across biological membranes. These
bolaamphiphiles are a unique class of compounds that have two hydrophilic headgroups placed at
each ends of a hydrophobic domain. Bolaamphiphiles can form vesicles that consist of
monolayer membrane that surrounds an aqueous core. Vesicles made from natural
bolaamphiphiles, such as those extracted from archaebacteria (archaesomes), are very stable and,
therefore, might be employed for targeted drug delivery. However, bolaamphiphiles from
archaebacteria are heterogeneous and cannot be easily extracted or chemically synthesized.
[0009]          Thus., there remains a need to make new compositions and for novel methods to
deliver biologically active drugs into the brain. The compounds, compositions, and methods
described herein are directed toward this end.

the Formula herein recited and/or described, which expression includes the prodrugs, the
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates, e.g., hydrates, where the context so permits.
Similarly, reference to intermediates, whether or not they themselves are claimed, is meant to
embrace their salts, and solvates, where the context so permits.
[0096]          These and other exemplary substituents are described in more detail in the
Detailed Description, Examples, and claims. The invention is not intended to be limited in any
manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents.

[0097]          "Pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved or approvable by a regulatory
agency of the Federal or a state government or the corresponding agency in countries other than
the United States, or that is listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized
pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly, in humans.
[0098]          "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt of a compound of the invention
that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the
parent compound. In particular, such salts are non-toxic may be inorganic or organic acid
addition salts and base addition salts. Specifically, such salts include: (1) acid addition salts,
formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric
acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic
acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic

hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable cation" refers to an acceptable cationic counter-ion of an acidic
functional group. Such cations are exemplified by sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
ammonium, tetraalkylammonium cations, and the like (see, e.g., Berge, et al., J. Pharm. Sci.
66(1): 1-79 (Jan."77).
[0099]          "Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or
carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered.
[00100]         "Pharmaceutically acceptable metabolically cleavable group" refers to a group
which is cleaved in vivo to yield the parent molecule of the structural Formula indicated herein.
Examples of metabolically cleavable groups include -COR, -COOR,-CONRR and -CH 2OR
radicals, where R is selected independently at each occurrence from alkyl, trialkylsilyl,
carbocyclic aryl or carbocyclic aryl substituted with one or more of alkyl, halogen, hydroxy or
alkoxy. Specific examples of representative metabolically cleavable groups include acetyl,
methoxycarbonyl, benzoyl, methoxymethyl and trimethylsilyl groups.
[00101]         "Prodrugs" refers to compounds, including derivatives of the compounds of the
invention,which have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological
conditions the compounds of the invention that are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such
examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N
alkylmorpholine esters and the like. Other derivatives of the compounds of this invention have
activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers
advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism
(see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs
include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters
prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of
the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed
anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic
groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are particular prodrugs. In some cases it is
desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or
((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Particularly the C1 to C8 alkyl, C2 -C8 alkenyl, C2-Cs alkynyl,
aryl, C7-C 12 substituted aryl, and C7-C 12 arylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.
[00102]         "Solvate" refers to forms of the compound that are associated with a solvent or
water (also referred to as "hydrate"), usually by a solvolysis reaction. This physical association
includes hydrogen bonding. Conventional solvents include water, ethanol, acetic acid and the
like. The compounds of the invention may be prepared e.g. in crystalline form and may be
solvated or hydrated. Suitable solvates include pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, such as
                                                  -29-

hydrates, and further include both stoichiometric solvates and non-stoichiometric solvates. In
certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent
molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. "Solvate" encompasses
both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Representative solvates include hydrates, ethanolates
and methanolates.
[00103]          A "subject" to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited
to, humans (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g, infant, child,
adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult)) and/or a non
human animal, e.g., a mammal such as primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys),
cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, rodents, cats, and/or dogs. In certain embodiments, the subject
is a human. In certain embodiments, the subject is a non-human animal. The terms "human",
"patient" and "subject" are used interchangeably herein.
[00104]          "Therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when
administered to a subject for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the
disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" can vary depending on the compound, the
disease and its severity, and the age, weight, etc., of the subject to be treated.
[00105]          "Preventing" or "prevention" refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring or
developing a disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease
not to develop in a subject not yet exposed to a disease-causing agent, or predisposed to the
disease in advance of disease onset.
[00106]          The term "prophylaxis" is related to "prevention", and refers to a measure or
procedure the purpose of which is to prevent, rather than to treat or cure a disease. Non-limiting
examples of prophylactic measures may include the administration of vaccines; the
administration of low molecular weight heparin to hospital patients at risk for thrombosis due, for
example, to immobilization; and the administration of an anti-malarial agent such as chloroquine,
in advance of a visit to a geographical region where malaria is endemic or the risk of contracting
malaria is high.
[00107]          "Treating" or "treatment" of any disease or disorder refers, in certain
embodiments, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting the disease or reducing the
manifestation, extent or severity of at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another
embodiment "treating" or "treatment" refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter,
which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or
"treatment" refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a
discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In a
further embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" relates to slowing the progression of the disease.

[001081          As used herein, the term "isotopic variant" refers to a compound that contains
unnatural proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound.
For example, an "isotopic variant" of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive
isotopes, such as for example, deuterium (2H or D), carbon-13 ( C), nitrogen-15 ( 5 N), or the
like. It will be understood that, in a compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the
following atoms, where present, may vary, so that for example, any hydrogen may be 2H/D, any
                  13                            15
carbon may be       C, or any nitrogen may be     N, and that the presence and placement of such
atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the invention may include the
preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the
resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The
radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e.,  1C,  are particularly useful for this
purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further, compounds
may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as "C, "F,          0 and
13
  N, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate
receptor occupancy. All isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not,
are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.
[00109]          It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula
but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in
space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are
termed "stereoisomers".
[00110]          Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed
"diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed
"enantiomers". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, when it is bonded to
four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by
the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing
rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized
light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A
chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture
containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".
[00111]          "Tautomers" refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular
compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus,
two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of 7c electrons and an atom (usually
H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by
treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro- forms
of phenylnitromethane, which are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.

Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and
biological activity of a compound of interest.
[00112]          As used herein a pure enantiomeric compound is substantially free from other
enantiomers or stereoisomers of the compound (i.e., in enantiomeric excess). In other words, an
"S" form of the compound is substantially free from the "R" form of the compound and is, thus,
in enantiomeric excess of the "R" form. The term "enantiomerically pure" or "pure enantiomer"
denotes that the compound comprises more than 75% by weight, more than 80% by weight, more
      85                         9                          9                          92

      99 9
than     . % by weight, of the enantiomer. In certain embodiments, the weights are based upon
total weight of all enantiomers or stereoisomers of the compound.
[00113]         As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term "enantiomerically pure R
compound" refers to at least about 80% by weight R-compound and at most about 20% by
weight S-compound, at least about 90% by weight R-compound and at most about 10% by
weight S-compound, at least about 95% by weight R-compound and at most about 5% by weight

compound, at least about 99.9% by weight R-compound or at most about 0.l1% by weight S
compound. In certain embodiments, the weights are based upon total weight of compound.
[00114]         As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term "enantiomerically pure S
compound" or "S-compound" refers to at least about 80% by weight S-compound and at most
about 20% by weight R-compound, at least about 90% by weight S-compound and at most about
 10% by weight R-compound, at least about 9 5% by weight S-compound and at most about 5%

compound.
[00115]         In the compositions provided herein, an enantiomerically pure compound or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or prodrug thereof can be present with other
active or inactive ingredients. For example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising
enantiomerically pure R-compound can comprise, for example, about 90% excipient and about
 10% enantiomerically pure R-compound. In certain embodiments, the enantiomerically pure R

example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising enantiomerically pure S-compound can
comprise, for example, about 90% excipient and about 10% enantiomerically pure S-compound.
In certain embodiments, the enantiomerically pure S-compound in such compositions can, for
example, comprise, at least about 95% by weight S-compound and at most about 5% by weight
R-compound, by total weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient
can be formulated with little or no excipient or carrier.
[00116]         The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers;
such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)- stereoisomers or as
mixtures thereof.
[00117]         Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in
the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures,
racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the
separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.
[00118]         One having ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that the
maximum number of heteroatoms in a stable, chemically feasible heterocyclic ring, whether it is
aromatic or non aromatic, is determined by the size of the ring, the degree of unsaturation and the
valence of the heteroatoms. In general, a heterocyclic ring may have one to four heteroatoms so
long as the heteroaromatic ring is chemically feasible and stable.

more bolaamphiphilic compounds and kyotorphine or enkephaline. In one embodiment, the
bolaamphiphilic compounds and kyotorphine or enkephaline are encapsulated within the nano
particle.
[00187]          In another specific aspect, provided herein are nano-particles, comprising one or
more bolaamphiphilic compounds and CPT- 11.
[00188]          In another specific aspect, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions,

[00191]          The Derivatives and Precursors disclosed can be prepared as illustrated in the
Schemes provided herein. The syntheses can involve initial construction of, for example,
vernonia oil or direct functionalization of natural derivatives by organic synthesis manipulations
such as, but not limiting to, epoxide ring opening. In those processes involving oxiranyl ring
opening, the epoxy group is opened by the addition of reagents such as carboxylic acids or
organic or inorganic nucleophiles. Such ring opening results in a mixture of two products in
which the new group is introduced at either of the two carbon atoms of the epoxide moiety. This
provides beta substituted alcohols in which the substitution position most remote from the CO
group of the main aliphatic chain of the vemonia oil derivative is arbitrarily assigned as position
 1, while the neighboring substituted carbon position is designated position 2. For simplicity

purposes only, the Derivatives and Precursors shown herein may indicate structures with the
hydroxy group always at position 2 but the Derivatives and Precursors wherein the hydroxy is at
position 1 are also encompassed by the invention. Thus, a radical of the formula --CH(OH)-
CH(R)-- refers to the substitution of -- OH at either the carbon closer to the CO group, designated
position 2 or to the carbon at position 1. Moreover, with respect to the preparation of
symmetrical bolaamphiphiles made via introducing the head groups through an epoxy moiety
(e.g., as in vernolic acid) or a double bond (-C=C-) as in mono unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic
acid) a mixture of three different derivatives will be produced. In certain embodiments, vesicles
are prepared using the mixture of unfractionated positional isomers. In one aspect of this
embodiment, where one or more bolas are prepared from vernolic acid, and in which a hydroxy
group as well as the head group introduced through an epoxy or a fatty acid with the head group
introduced through a double bond (-C=C-), the bola used in vesicle preparation can actually be a
mixture of three different positional isomers.
[00192]          In other embodiments, the three different derivatives are isolated. Accordingly,
the vesicles disclosed herein can be made from a mixture of the three isomers of each derivative
or, in other embodiments, the individual isomers can be isolated and used for preparation of
vesicles.
[00193]          Symmetrical bolaamphiphiles can form relatively stable self aggregate vesicle
structures by the use of additives such as cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives (e.g., cholesterol
hemisuccinate, cholesterol oleyl ether, anionic and cationic derivatives of cholesterol and the
like), or other additives including single headed amphiphiles with one, two or multiple aliphatic
chains such as phospholipids, zwitterionic, acidic, or cationic lipids. Examples of zwitterionic
lipids are phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanol amines and sphingomyelins. Examples of
acidic amphiphilic lipids are phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols,
and phosphatidic acids. Examples of cationic amphipathic lipids are diacyl trimethylammonium
propanes, diacyl dimethylammonium propanes, and stearylamines cationic amphiphiles such as
spermine cholesterol carbamates, and the like, in optimum concentrations which fill in the larger
spaces on the outer surfaces, and/or add additional hydrophilicity to the particles. Such additives
may be added to the reaction mixture during formation of nanoparticles to enhance stability of
the nanoparticles by filling in the void volumes of in the upper surface of the vesicle membrane.
[00194]          Stability of nano vesicles according to the present disclosure can be demonstrated
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For example,
suspensions of the vesicles can be left to stand for 1, 5, 10, and 30 days to assess the stability of
the nanoparticle solution/suspension and then analyzed by DLS and TEM.

[00195]          The vesicles disclosed herein may encapsulate within their core the active agent,
which in particular embodiments is selected from peptides, proteins, nucleotides and or non
polymeric agents. In certain embodiments, the active agent is also associated via one or more
non-covalent interactions to the vesicular membrane on the outer surface and/or the inner surface,
optionally as pendant decorating the outer or inner surface, and may further be incorporated into
the membrane surrounding the core. In certain aspects, biologically active peptides, proteins,
nucleotides or non-polymeric agents that have a net electric charge, may associate ionically with
oppositely charged headgroups on the vesicle surface and/or form salt complexes therewith.
[00196]          In particular aspects of these embodiments, additives which may be
bolaamphiphiles or single headed amphiphiles, comprise one or more branching alkyl chains
bearing polar or ionic pendants, wherein the aliphatic portions act as anchors into the vesicle's
membrane and the pendants (e.g., chitosan derivatives or polyamines or certain peptides)
decorate the surface of the vesicle to enhance penetration through various biological barriers such
as the intestinal tract and the BBB, and in some instances are also selectively hydrolyzed at a
given site or within a given organ. The concentration of these additives is readily adjusted
according to experimental determination.
[00197]          In certain embodiments, the oral formulations of the present disclosure comprise
agents that enhance penetration through the membranes of the GI tract and enable passage of
intact nanoparticles containing the drug. These agents may be any of the additives mentioned
above and, in particular aspects of these embodiment, include chitosan and derivatives thereof,
serving as vehicle surface ligands, as decorations or pendants on the vesicles, or the agents may
be excipients added to the formulation.
[00198]          In other embodiments, the nanoparticles and vesicles disclosed herein may
comprise the fluorescent marker carboxyfluorescein (CF) encapsulated therein while in particular
aspects, the nanoparticle and vesicles of the present disclosure may be decorated with one or
more of PEG, e.g. PEG2000-vemonia derivatives as pendants. For example, two kinds of PEG
vernonia derivatives can be used: PEG-ether derivatives, wherein PEG is bound via an ether
bond to the oxygen of the opened epoxy ring of, e.g., vernolic acid and PEG-ester derivatives,
wherein PEG is bound via an ester bond to the carboxylic group of, e.g., vernolic acid.
[00199]          In other embodiments, vesicles, made from synthetic amphiphiles, as well as
liposomes, made from synthetic or natural phospholipids, substantially (or totally) isolate the
therapeutic agent from the environment allowing each vesicle or liposome to deliver many
molecules of the therapeutic agent. Moreover, the surface properties of the vesicle or liposome
can be modified for biological stability, enhanced penetration through biological barriers and
targeting, independent of the physico-chemical properties of the encapsulated drug.

use as a pharmaceutical or a medicament.
[00208]          Generally, the compounds provided herein are administered in a therapeutically
effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be
determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to
be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age,
weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the
like.
[00209]          The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be administered by a
variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular,
and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds provided herein are

patches all for transdermal administration.
[00210]          The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid
solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are
presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term "unit dosage forms" refers
to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals,
each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired
therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage
forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills,
tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the
compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably
from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and
processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.
[00211]          Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or

[00212]         Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or
phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As before, the active
compound in such compositions is typically a minor component, often being from about 0.05 to
 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.
[00213]         Transdermal compositions are typically formulated as a topical ointment or cream
containing the active ingredient(s), generally in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20%
by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about
 10% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight. When formulated
as a ointment, the active ingredients will typically be combined with either a paraffinic or a
water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream
with, for example an oil-in-water cream base. Such transdermal formulations are well-known in
the art and generally include additional ingredients to enhance the dermal penetration of stability
of the active ingredients or the formulation. All such known transdermal formulations and
ingredients are included within the scope provided herein.
[00214]         The compounds provided herein can also be administered by a transdermal device.
Accordingly, transdermal administration can be accomplished using a patch either of the
reservoir or porous membrane type, or of a solid matrix variety.

[00220]          The following formulation examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical
compositions that may be prepared in accordance with this invention. The present invention,
however, is not limited to the following pharmaceutical compositions.

                                   METHODS OF TREATMENT
[00222]          Bolaamphiphilic vesicles (bolavesicles) may have certain advantages over
conventional liposomes as potential vehicles for drug delivery. Bolavesicles have thinner
membranes than comparable liposomal bilayer, and therefore possess bigger inner volume and
hence higher encapsulation capacity than liposomes of the same diameter. Moreover,
bolavesicles are more physically-stable than conventional liposomes, but can be destabilized in a
triggered fashion (e.g., by hydrolysis of the headgroups using a specific enzymatic reaction) thus
allowing controlled release of the encapsulated material at the site of action (i.e., drug targeting).
[00223]          Thus, various biologically active drug molecueles can be encapsulated in the
bolaamphiphilic vesicles and then delivered to the brain in sufficient concentrations for
therapeutic use.
[00224]          The bola vesicles aggregate into encapsulating monolayer membranes which,
together with functional surface groups, provide vesicle stability, penetrability through the BBB
and a controlled release mechanism that enables the release of the encapsulated drug primarily in
the brain.
[00225]          The novel nanovesicles can encapsulates drugs, gets through the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) and releases the drug in the brain. A major factor limiting the efficacy of some
chemotherapeutical agents that are potentially effective in the treatment of malignant gliomas,
particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is that most drugs cannot cross the BBB. A study
from Duke University showed that, out of 40 drugs tested, CPT- 11 (Irinotecan, used for solid
                                                  - 53 -

tumors) was the most potent chemotherapeutic agent against patients' gliomas implanted in mice,
and was effective against every tumor tested.
[00226]          However, attempts to treat GBM patients with CPT-1 1 were unsuccessful because
very little gets through the BBB and reaches the tumor. Hence, CPT-1 1 encapsulated within bola
vesicles, can penetrate the brain via the intense capillary network that supplies blood to the brain
and can release CPT-1 1 upon reaching tumor cells. Thus, it would be effective in treating GBM.
The efficacy of CPT- 11 delivered by bola vesicles may be further increased by administering it
with oral temozolamide which, in combination with radiotherapy, prolongs survival by months
and, based on literature, acts synergistically with CPT-1Ito kill gliomas.
                             GENERAL SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES
[00227]          The compounds provided herein can be purchased or prepared from readily
available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. See, e.g.,
Synthetic Schemes below. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process
conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.)
are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction
conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be
determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.
[00228]          Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional
protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing
undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as
well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For
example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W.

[00232]         Enantiomerically pure compounds can also be recovered either from the
crystallized diastereomer or from the mother liquor, depending on the solubility properties of the
particular acid resolving agent employed and the particular acid enantiomer used. The identity
and optical purity of the particular compound so recovered can be determined by polarimetry or
other analytical methods known in the art. The diasteroisomers can then be separated, for
example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization, and the desired enantiomer regenerated
by treatment with an appropriate base or acid. The other enantiomer may be obtained from the
racemate in a similar manner or worked up from the liquors of the first separation.

                                      Bolaamphiphile synthesis
[00235]         The boloamphiphles or bolaamphiphilic compounds of the invention can be
synthesized following the procedures described previously (see below).
[00236]         Briefly, the carboxylic group of methyl vernolate or vemolic acid was interacted
with aliphatic diols to obtain bisvernolesters. Then the epoxy group of the vernolate moiety,
located on C12 and C13 of the aliphatic chain of vernolic acid, was used to introduce two ACh
headgroups on the two vicinal carbons obtained after the opening of the oxirane ring. For GLH
                                                - 56 -

20 (Table 1), the ACh head group was attached to the vernolate skeleton through the nitrogen
atom of the choline moiety. The bolaamphiphile was prepared in a two-stage synthesis: First,
opening of the epoxy ring with a haloacetic acid and, second, quaternization with the NN
dimethylamino ethyl acetate. For GLH-19 (Table 1) that contains an ACh head group attached to
the vemolate skeleton through the acetyl group, the bolaamphiphile was prepared in a three-stage
synthesis, including opening of the epoxy ring with glutaric acid, then esterification of the free
carboxylic group with NN-dimethyl amino ethanol and the final product was obtained by
quaternization of the head group, using methyl iodide followed by exchange of the iodide ion by
chloride using an ion exchange resin.
[00237]         Each bolaamphiphile was characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and IR
spectroscopy. The purity of the two bolaamphiphiles was >97% as determined by HPLC.
[00238]         Materials. Iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac) 3), diphenyl ether, 1,2
hexadecanediol, oleic acid, oleylamine, and carboxyfluorescein (CF) were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (Rehovot, Israel). Chloroform and ethanol were purchased from Bio-Lab Ltd. Jerusalem,
Israel. 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(l'-rac-glycerol) (DMPG), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn
glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC), cholesterol (CHOL), cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) were purchased from Avanti
Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), The diacetylenic monomer 10,12- tricosadiynoic acid was
purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), and purified by dissolving the powder in
chloroform, filtering the resulting solution through a 0.45 pm nylon filter (Whatman Inc., Clifton,
NJ, USA), and evaporation of the solvent. 1-(4 trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5
hexatriene (TMA-DPH) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR, USA).

determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, UK). The amount of the
biologically active drug encapsulated in the vesicles can be determined by HPLC and/or UV
spectroscopy (G Gnanarajan, et al, 2009) after separating the non-encapsulated drug, by size

[00242]        EPR spectra of biologically active drug embedded bolavesicles resuspended in
PBS can be obtained using a Bruker EMX-220 X-band (-9.4 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped
with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 temperature accessories and an Agilent 53150A frequency
counter. Spectra can be recorded at room temperature with the non-saturating incident
microwave power 20 mW and the 100 KHz magnetic field modulation of 0.2 mT amplitude.
Processing of EPR spectra, determination of spectral parameters can be done using Bruker WIN
EPR software.

                     Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)
[00243]         Specimens studied by cryo-TEM were prepared. Sample solutions (4 PL) are
deposited on a glow discharged, 300 mesh, lacey carbon copper grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA,
USA). The excess liquid is blotted and the specimen was vitrified in a Leica EM GP vitrification
system in which the temperature and relative humidity are controlled. The samples are examined
at -180 'C using a FEI Tecnai 12 G2 TWIN TEM equipped with a Gatan 626 cold stage, and the
images are recorded (Gatan model 794 charge-coupled device camera) at 120 kV in low-dose
mode. Figure 1 shows TEM micrograph of vesicles from GLH-20 (A) and their size distribution

[00244]         Lipid/polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicles (PDA/DMPC 3:2, mole ratio) are prepared
by dissolving the lipid components in chloroform/ ethanol and drying together in vacuo. Vesicles
are subsequently prepared in DDW by probe-sonication of the aqueous mixture at 70'C for 3
min. The vesicle samples are then cooled at room temperature for an hour and kept at 4'C
overnight. The vesicles are then polymerized using irradiation at 254 nm for 10-20 s, with the
resulting emulsions exhibiting an intense blue appearance. PDA fluorescence is measured in 96
well microplates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) on a Fluoroscan Ascent
fluorescence plate reader (Thermo Vantaa, Finland). All measurements are performed at room
temperature at 485 nm excitation and 555 nm emission using LP filters with normal slits.
Acquisition of data is automatically performed every 5 min for 60 min. Samples comprised 30
pL of DMPC/PDA vesicles and 5pL bolaamphiphilic vesicles assembled with biologically active
drug, followed by addition of 30 pL 50 mM Tris-base buffer (pH 8.0).
[00245]         A quantitative value for the increasing of the fluorescence intensity within the
PDA/PC-labeled vesicles is given by the fluorescence colorimetric response (%FCR), which is
defined as follows 2 7 :
                             Eq. 1.          %FCR = [(F1 -Fo)/F 100 ] -100
[00246]         Where F1 is the fluorescence emission of the lipid/PDA vesicles after addition of
the tested membrane-active compounds, FO is the fluorescence of the control sample (without
addition of the compounds), and F 100 is the fluorescence of a sample heated to produce the
highest fluorescence emission of the red PDA phase minus the fluorescence of the control
sample.

by Prof. Philip Lazarovici (Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, The Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, Israel). The b.End3 cells were cultured in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100
pg/mL streptomycin (Biological Industries Ltd., Beit Haemek, Israel). The cells are maintained
in an incubator at 37'C in a humidified atmosphere with    5% CO 2.

[00248]         b.End3 cells are grown on 24-well plates or on coverslips (for FACS and
fluorescence microscopy analysis, respectively). The medium is replaced with culture medium
without serum and CF solution, or tested bolavesicles (equivalent to 0.5 pg/mL CF), or
equivalent volume of the medium are added to the cells and incubated for 5 hr at 4'C or at 37'C.
At the end of the incubation, cells are extensively washed with complete medium and with PBS,
and are either detached from the plates using trypsin-EDTA solution (Biological Industries Ltd.,
Beit Haemek, Israel) and analyzed by FACS (FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences,
USA), or fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde in PBS, washed twice with PBS, mounted on slides
using Mowiol-based mounting solution and analyzed using a FV1000-IX81 confocal microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with 60x objective. All the images are acquired using the
same imaging settings and are not corrected or modified. The Figure 2 shows head group
hydrolysis by AChE (A) of GLH-19 (blue) and GLH-20 (red) and release of CF from GLH-19
vesicles (B) and GLH-20 vesicles (C). AChE causes the release of encapsulated material from
GLH-20 vesicles, but not from GLH-19 vesicles (Fig.2). The vesicles are capable of delivering
small molecules, such as carboxyfluorescein (CF), into a mouse brain, but the fluorescent dye
accumulates only if it is delivered in vesicles that release their encapsulated CF in presence of
AChE, namely, GLH-20 vesicles (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the release is due to head
group hydrolysis by AChE in the brain. Corroboration for this conclusion also comes from an
experiment showing that when an analgesic peptide is delivered to the brain by the bola vesicles,
analgesia (which is caused when the encapsulated peptide is released in the brain) was observed
only with GLH-20 vesicles, but not by GLH-19 vesicles (Figure 4A).The vesicles do not break
the BBB, but rather penetrate it in their intact form, as indicated by the finding that analgesia is
obtained only when enkephalin is administered while encapsulated within the vesicles, but not
when free enkephalin is administered together with empty vesicles (Figure 4B).
[00249]         The ACh head groups also provide the vesicles with cationic surfaces, which
promote penetration through the BBB [Lu et al, 2005] and transport of the encapsulated material
into the brain. Toxicity studies showed that the dose which induced the first toxic signs was 10
20 times higher than the doses needed to obtain analgesia by encapsulated analgesic peptides.
[00250]         The addition of chitosan (CS) surface groups, by employing CS-vernolate
conjugates, increased BBB permeability of the vesicles (Figure 4B), probably by increasing
transcytosis [Newton, 2006]. However, the CS groups, when added to the vesicles by employing
fatty acid-CS conjugate (in this case, vemolic acid), are not stable in circulation as surface groups
because of the low energy barrier for lipid exchange of such conjugates. The inventors propose to
make stabilized CS surface groups by using bolas that the inventors will synthesize with
covalently-attached CS head groups [see, Experimental Design and Methods, below].

[00251]         In addition to the peptide leu-enkephalin, and the small molecules: CF, uranyl
acetate, kyotorphin and sucrose, the inventors have also successfully encapsulated in these
vesicles the proteins albumin and trypsinogen and the polysaccharide Dextran-FITC (MW 9000).
Albumin-FITC, encapsulated, was delivered successfully to the brain (Fig. 5B), while un
encapsulated albumin-FITC showed little, if any, brain accumulation (Fig 5A), indicating that the
vesicle transported the protein into the brain through the BBB. These results strongly suggest that
the vesicles can be made to encapsulate other molecules, such as anti-retroviral drugs, and deliver
them into the brain without harming the BBB.

                                          Statistical analysis
[00252]         The data are presented as mean and standard deviations (SD) or standard errors of
mean (SEM). Statistical differences between the control and the studied formulations are
analyzed using ANOVA followed by Dunnett post-test using InStat 3.0 software (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). P values of less than 0.05 are defined as statistically
significant.

                                      Encapsulation of CPT- 11
[00253]         A) Optimization of vesicle formation: Vesicles are prepared by film hydration,
followed by sonication. Each of the vesicle formulations can be examined for vesicle size (by
dynamic light scattering), morphology (by cryo-transmission electron microscopy), zeta potential
(by Zeta Potential Analyzer) and stability (by fluorescence measurements of encapsulated CF at
various times after vesicle preparation). Stability of vesicles can be determined in presence and
absence of ChE, with and without an inhibitor of the enzyme (e.g., pyridostigmine).
[00254]         B) Encapsulation of CPT-11: To successfully encapsulate CPT-11 (MW 586.67,
water solubility of 25 mg/ml with bis-piperidine moiety, which forms an ammonium salt in acid)
within the vesicles, the active loading approach can be used. CPT-1 1 can be encapsulated in its
active lactonic form, and not in the inactive carboxylate form. The loading conditions based on
conditions developed for liposomal formulations using a pH gradient between the liposome core
can be used and the bathing medium, whereas the internal volume can be acidic compared to the
external solution.
[00255]         For encapsulations, vesicles can be formed in acidic buffers, such as citrates. The
vesicles can be purified on a GPC column to separate encapsulated CPT-1 1 from non
encapsulated material. Percent encapsulation can be determined by UV absorption of the CTP

 lI's aromatic groups after lysis with a detergent. To maximize CPT- 11 loading and minimize
leakage, the composition of the vesicle's membrane can be optimized by varying both the ratio
between bolaamphiphiles in the vesicle formulation and the proportion of different additives used
in the vesicle formulation, such as cholesterol hemisuccinate and neutral cholesterol; or drug
loading with respect to the relative concentration of CPT- 11 to vesicles, the temperature during
loading, internal buffer composition and the pH gradient across the vesicle's membrane.
[00256]          The entrapped CPT-1 1 may be stabilized by adding, to the vesicle core, agents
that help to prevent leakage, such as dextran sulfate28, copper sulfate and other transition metal
salts29, and polymeric or highly charged nonpolymeric polyanionic trapping agents.

                           Determination of encapsulated CPT- 11 activity
[00257]          To ensure that the encapsulation process did not reduce the cytotoxic activity of
CPT-1 1, the encapsulated CPT-1 1 can be released from the vesicles by ChE treatment, and the
released CPT- 11 can be collected from the supernatant following centrifugation. The IC50 of the
released CPT- 11 can be determined by using U87 glioblastoma cell line and by a standard
viability assay (e.g., MTT) in comparison to that of standard CPT-11.
[00258]          As described here a novel formulations of bolavesicles can be produced through
co-assembly of biologically active drugs with bolaamphiphile/lipid unilamellar vesicles. The
formulations can be examined for their chemical and biophysical properties.
[00259]          The incorporation of biologically active drug within the bolavesicles is shown to
significantly modulate interactions with membrane bilayers in model systems. This observation is
important, suggesting that biologically active drugs encapsulated in bolavesicles might be
excellent candidates for targeting and transport of different molecular cargoes into the brain.
