    COBALT-BASED FISCHER-TROPSCH SYNTHESIS CATALYST COATED
       WITH MESOPOROUS MATERIALS AND PREPARATION METHOD
                                         THEREFOR
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[1] The invention belongs to the field of the industrially catalyzed Fischer Tropsch
synthesis, and particularly relates to a mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst
for Fischer Tropsch synthesis and a method for preparing the same.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[2] Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are important energies on which the existence and
development of the human civilization are dependent, and are the safeguard for the
national economic sustainable development and security and stability. With the
continuous exploit of such energies, the energy crisis becomes serious, and therefore it is
an urgent problem for scientists to seek renewable energy. China is a big agricultural
country and has a great quantity of different kinds of renewable biomass. It is an
important route to substitute the fossil energy by the renewable biomass energy for
solving the energy crisis.
[3] Fischer Tropsch synthesis is a process including gasification the biomass into
synthetic gas and transformation of the synthetic gas (CO+H 2) into the hydrocarbon in the
presence of the catalyst. The route of transforming the biomass into the synthetic gas and
producing different kinds of oils by the Fischer Tropsch synthesis is able to effectively
solve the energy crisis.
[4] A basic reaction for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis is CO+2H 2 ->(-CH 2-)+H       20.  As
water is produced along with the production of the hydrocarbon, the water concentration
may reaches very high in some reactors adopting post mixing, such as the slurry reactor.
Currently, the most widely applied industrialized catalyst for the Fischer Tropsch
synthesis adopts iron and cobalt as the active components. For the cobalt-based catalyst
                                               1

for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis, the metal cobalt is the active component of the catalyst
and is probably oxidized and deactivated by the product water, which accounts for 50
wt. % of the total products. In addition, the higher the conversion of CO, the deactivation
is more serious. For example, Bertole, et al., (J.Catal., 2002, 210: 84-96) has reported that
water deactivates the unsupported Co-based catalyst, because that the high water pressure
(>0.4MPa) easily leads to sintering of the catalyst, the specific area of cobalt is reduced,
and the activity of the metal is reduced or the absorption of CO on the surface of the
catalyst is reduced. Batholomew (Appl. Catal. A, 2001, 212.17-60) also holds the opinion
that the water vapor increases the sintering rate of the unsupported catalyst. As the
cobalt-based catalyst has relatively high production cost, the catalyst is highly required on
the stability, activity, and selectivity, and therefore it is very necessary to prepare
water-insensitive catalyst.
[5] Chinese patent publication number CN101203304A has disclosed a cobalt-based
catalyst including oxidized carrier. The oxidized carrier includes aluminum and between
0.01 and 20 wt. % of lithium, in which, lithium exists in the form of lithium aluminate.
Such the lithium aluminate-contained carrier has improved water resistance, reduces the
formation of dialuminium cobalt tetraoxide, and possesses high activity and selectivity of
Cs*. However, the preparation of the carrier is difficult and requires to be calcined at
between 700 and 1000 C for a long time.
[6] Chinese patent publication number CN1785515A has disclosed a catalyst for
synthesizing middle distillate by syngas. The catalyst adopts mesoporous zirconium
dioxide as the carrier. The catalyst contains between 5 and 35 wt. % of the metal cobalt,
between 0 and 2 wt. % of a noble metal, and between 0 and 10 wt. % of non-noble
metallic oxide. The catalyst has high activity, good stability, high selectivity of
hydrocarbons containing between 11 and 20 carbons, and good mechanical property.
However, the preparation of the mesoporous zirconium dioxide is complicate and costly.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[7] In view of the above-described problems, it is one objective of the invention to
provide a mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer Tropsch synthesis
                                                 2

and a method for preparing the same. The catalyst has long service life, good stability,
and controllable thickness of shell layer.
[8] To achieve the above objective, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention,
there is provided a mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer Tropsch
synthesis. The catalyst comprises a silica carrier. A surface of the silica carrier is loaded
with an active component cobalt and a selective promoter zirconium. An external of the
active component cobalt and the selective promoter zirconium is coated with a shell layer
of a mesoporous material.
[9] The catalyst of the invention is prepared by firstly loading the active component on
the surface of the silica carrier by impregnation, and coating the mesoporous material
possessing regular pore channels outside the active component, during which, a thickness
of the shell layer of the mesoporous material is controllable by changing parameters. The
thickness of the shell layer of the mesoporous material is designed to be between 1.8 and
 13 pum, and preferably between 2.0 and 6.0 ptm. Thus, the shell layer of the mesoporous
material encapsulates the active component inside the pore channels to avoid the
aggregation and shedding of the active component, and in the meanwhile, the regular
pore channel of the mesoporous material provides mass transfer channel for CO and H2 to
ensure the high reactivity of the catalyst.
[10] Preferably, to avoid the decrease in the activity of the catalyst because of the
shedding of the active component in the reaction process or the transfer process, and to
prevent the active metal Co from being oxidized and deactivated by water produced in
the reaction, the shell layer of the mesoporous material is coated with a hydrophobic layer

[34] Advantages of the mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer
Tropsch synthesis and the method for preparing the same according to embodiments of
the invention are summarized as follows:
[35] The cobalt-based catalyst for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis prepared in the invention
overcomes the limitation of the conventional cobalt-based catalyst and the eggshell type
catalyst. By firstly coating the shell layer of the mesoporous material on the surface of the
catalyst and controlling the thickness of the shell layer by process parameters, the active
component of the catalyst is protected, and in the meanwhile the structure of the pore
channels of the mesoporous material provides the channels for diffusion of CO and H2 .
Furthermore, the introduction of the superhydrophobic organic molecules into the shell
layer of the mesoporous material is able to effectively stop the water molecules from
inside the channels.
[36] Not only is the shedding of the active component prevented during the friction,
activation, or transfer process of the catalyst, but also the influence of the vapor on the
catalyst is avoided in the reaction. Thus, the stability of the catalyst is greatly improved,
the service life of the catalyst is effectively prolonged, and the industrial application
prospect of the catalyst is good. The Co-based catalyst of the invention possesses long
                                                 6

service life, high reactivity, good stability, high selectivity of Cs, and low selectivity of
methane, and therefore particularly adaptable to bubble column slurry reactor or
continuous stirred slurry reactor.

[80] The catalyst I comprises: an inorganic silica gel as a carrier, Co as an active
component, Zr as a promoter, a shell layer of a mesoporous material, and a hydrophobic
organic compound layer of y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. A content of Zr is 10 wt. %,
and a content of Co is 10 wt. %.

volume of 0.75 mL/g, an average pore size of 13 nm, and a particle size of 150 pm was

a third mixture. The third mixture was thereafter stirred at 25'C until a clarified solution
was yielded. 8.4 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate was added to the clarified solution and
continued stirring for 30 hrs to yield a precursor solution of a mesoporous material.
[85] 4) The precursor solution of the mesoporous material was transferred to a clean
teflon reactor. 10 g of the primary cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer Tropsch synthesis was
impregnated into the precursor solution of the mesoporous material to yield a fourth
mixture. The fourth mixture was then fixed in a device for hydrothermal synthesis,
crystalized at 80'C for 70 hrs at a rotational speed of 15 rpm. The fourth mixture was
then washed by distilled water to be neutral, dried at 120'C for 10 hrs, and calcined at
500'C for 8 hrs to yield a mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer
Tropsch synthesis.
[86] 5) The mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based catalyst for Fischer Tropsch
synthesis was impregnated into 200 mL of a y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane solution, and
sealed for 15 hrs. A resulting fifth mixture was then rinsed by acetone for 2 times, dried at
90'C for 5 hrs to yield the catalyst I, i,.e., a mesoporous material-coated cobalt-based
catalyst possessing hydrophobic property.
[87]It was found from detection that the catalyst I has a specific area of 350 m 2/g, a pore
volume of 0.6 mL/g, an average pore size of 9 nm, and a thickness of the shell layer of 6
pm.
                     Comparative example 1 Conventional catalyst A
[88] The conventional catalyst A comprises: an inorganic silica gel as a carrier, Co as an
active component, and Zr as a promoter. A content of Zr is 5 wt. %, and a content of Co is
20 wt. %.
                                                 14

[89] Preparation of the catalyst A is as follows:
[90]1) 30 g of the inorganic silica gel carrier having a specific area of 280 m2/g, a pore
volume of 1.25 mL/g, an average pore size of 13.6 nm, and a particle size of 40 pm was
impregnated into 45 mL of an aqueous solution comprising 5.07 g of ZrO(NO 3) 2 to yield
a first mixture. The first mixture was then aged in air for 16 hrs, dried at 110 C for 8 hrs,
and calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 C for 10 hrs to yield a zirconium-loaded
inorganic silica gel carrier.
[91]2) The zirconium-loaded inorganic silica gel carrier was impregnated into 63 mL of
an aqueous solution comprising 39.43 g of Co(N0 3)3-6H 20 to yield a second mixture.
Thereafter, the second mixture was aged in air for 16 hrs, dried at 1 10 C for 8 hrs, and
calcined in the muffle furnace at 450'C for 10 hrs to yield a cobalt-based catalyst A for
Fischer Tropsch synthesis.
[92] Evaluation results of the synthesis of the liquid hydrocarbon using biomass
respectively in the presence of the catalysts B-I and the conventional catalyst A are
compared in Table 1.
[93] It was known from Table 1 that when the conventional catalyst is coated with a shell
layer of the mesoporous material, the conversion of CO is not visibly changes and
approximately between 55 and 65 wt. %. This is primarily because that although the shell
layer of the mesoporous material has a certain thickness, the particle size of the catalyst is
relatively small, the mass transfer resistance is also relatively small, and the shell layer of
the mesoporous material provides mass transfer channels for H2 and CO. While the
selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbon is slightly improved and the selectivity of methane is
slightly decreased, which may be because that the shell layer of the mesoporous material
is capable of preventing the active component from shedding as a result of friction in the
process of activation and transfer. In addition, the shell layer of the mesoporous material
is capable of stopping water of the bulk from directly contacting the active center. After
hydrophobic organic modification of the surface of the shell layer, the selectivity of the
liquid hydrocarbon increases, and the selectivity of the methane is obviously decreased,
which indicates that the introduction of the hydrophobic substance into the shell layer of
the mesoporous material is capable of effectively preventing the catalyst from being
                                               15

oxidized by water and deactivated. Once the small molecule water is produced, it is blew
out of the shell layer along with the hydrophobic organic compound layer. Thus, the
Cobalt-based catalyst prepared in the invention has relatively high reactivity, high
selectivity of Cs*, and low selectivity of methane.
[94] Particularly after the introduction of the hydrophobic substance into the shell layer of
the mesoporous material, the selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbon is much greatly
improved. Because the molecular structure of the organic compound in the modified
catalyst F is relatively smaller, the hydrophobicity of the modified catalyst F is relatively
poor than those of the catalysts E and G. The price of the organic compound in the
modified catalyst E is higher than the modified catalyst G, and has easy volatilization and
strong corrosivity. The catalyst H has relatively small specific area and pore size, and the
activity thereof and the selectivity of the hydrocarbon are slightly reduced. The catalyst I
has relatively large particle size and thick shell layer, a certain mass transfer resistance,
and reduced conversion of CO, but the crystallization time of the catalyst I is relatively
long. Based on the above ground, the catalyst G is superior than the catalysts E, F, H, and
I.

[96] It is known from Table 2 and 3 that when the reaction time of the conventional
catalyst A in the absence of any modification reaches 800 hrs, the activity of the
conventional catalyst A begins to decrease, which may because Co on the surface of the
catalyst is shed off under the action of friction after long-term stirring, and water
produced from the reaction make the catalyst oxidized and deactivated. When the
conventional catalyst is coated with the shell layer of the mesoporous material to yield
the catalysts B and G, the reaction time is prolonged to 1500 hrs and the conversion of
CO still remains 55% above. This is probably because the shell layer of the catalyst is
able to protect the active center of the catalyst and prevent the metal part of the catalyst
from being shed off under the friction. Particularly for the catalyst G modified by the
hydrophobic organic substances, when the reaction operates for 2500 hrs, the activity of
the catalyst is still high, and the conversion of CO still remains approximately 60%, and
the selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbon is approximately 85%, which indicates that the
service life of the catalyst is obviously prolonged. This is because the introduction of the
hydrophobic group into the shell layer of the mesoporous material is able to effective
prevent the metal part from being shed off the catalyst, and effectively prevent water from
contacting with the active center, which may otherwise make the catalyst deactivated. In
summary, the Co-based catalyst prepared in the invention has great stability and
effectively prolonged service life.
