                SEAL CONFIGURATION FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL
          [001] This application is a divisional application of Australian application
number 2014296367, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
          [002] The present disclosure is directed towards an electrochemical cell, and
more specifically, to an electrochemical cell having a cascade sealing configuration
and configured for hydrogen reclamation.
          [003] Electrochemical cells, usually classified as fuel cells or electrolysis
cells, are devices used for generating current from chemical reactions, or inducing a
chemical reaction using a flow of current. A fuel cell converts the chemical energy of
a fuel (e.g., hydrogen, natural gas, methanol, gasoline, etc.) and an oxidant (air or
oxygen) into electricity and waste products of heat and water. A basic fuel cell
comprises a negatively charged anode, a positively charged cathode, and an ion
conducting material called an electrolyte.
          [004] Different fuel cell technologies utilize different electrolyte materials. A
Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, for example, utilizes a polymeric ion
conducting membrane as the electrolyte. In a hydrogen PEM fuel cell, hydrogen
atoms can electrochemically split into electrons and protons (hydrogen ions) at the
anode. The electrons flow through the circuit to the cathode and generate electricity,
while the protons diffuse through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode. At the
cathode, hydrogen protons can react with electrons and oxygen (supplied to the
cathode) to produce water and heat.
          [005] An electrolysis cell represents a fuel cell operated in reverse. A basic
electrolysis cell can function as a hydrogen generator by decomposing water into
hydrogen and oxygen gases when an external electric potential is applied. The
basic technology of a hydrogen fuel cell or an electrolysis cell can be applied to
electrochemical hydrogen manipulation, such as, electrochemical hydrogen
compression, purification, or expansion.
          [006] An electrochemical hydrogen compressor (EHC), for example, can be
used to selectively transfer hydrogen from one side of a cell to another. An EHC can
comprise a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between a first electrode (i.e.,
an anode) and a second electrode (i.e., a cathode). A gas containing hydrogen can
contact the first electrode and an electric potential difference can be applied between
1A72RA 1/     Dl-PAAA All i

the first and second electrodes. At the first electrode, the hydrogen molecules can
be oxidized and the reaction can produce two electrons and two protons. The two
protons are electrochemically driven through the membrane to the second electrode
of the cell, where they are rejoined by two rerouted electrons and reduced to form a
hydrogen molecule. The reactions taking place at the first electrode and second
electrode can be expressed as chemical equations, as shown below.
                 First electrode oxidation reaction:  H2 --* 2H+ + 2e
                 Second electrode reduction reaction: 2H+ + 2e- -> H2
                 Overall electrochemical reaction:   H2 ->   H2
        [007] EHCs operating in this manner are sometimes referred to as a
hydrogen pumps. When the hydrogen accumulated at the second electrode is
restricted to a confined space, the electrochemical cell compresses the hydrogen or
raises the pressure. The maximum pressure or flow rate an individual cell is capable
of producing can be limited based on the cell design.
        [008] To achieve greater compression or higher pressure, multiple cells can
be linked in series to form a multi-stage EHC. In a multi-stage EHC the gas flow
path, for example, can be configured so the compressed output gas of the first cell
can be the input gas of the second cell. Alternatively, single-stage cells can be
linked in parallel to increase the throughput capacity (i.e., total gas flow rate) of an
EHC. In both a single-stage and multi-stage EHC, the cells can be stacked and
each cell can include a cathode, an electrolyte membrane, and an anode. Each
cathode/membrane/anode assembly constitutes a "membrane electrode assembly",
or "MEA", which is typically supported on both sides by bipolar plates. In addition to
providing mechanical support, the bipolar plates physically separate individual cells
in a stack while electrically connecting them. The bipolar plates also act as current
collectors/conductors, and provide passages for the fuel. Typically, bipolar plates
are made from metals, for example, stainless steel, titanium, etc., and from non
metallic electrical conductors, for example, graphite.
        [009] Electrochemical hydrogen manipulation has emerged as a viable
alternative to the mechanical systems traditionally used for hydrogen management.
Successful commercialization of hydrogen as an energy carrier and the long-term
sustainability of a "hydrogen economy" depends largely on the efficiency and cost
effectiveness of fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and other hydrogen
manipulation/management systems (i.e., EHCs). Gaseous hydrogen is a convenient
                                            -2-

and common form for energy storage, usually by pressurized containment.
Advantageously, storing hydrogen at high pressure yields high energy density.
          [010] Mechanical compression is a traditional means to achieve
compression. However, there are disadvantages to mechanical compression. For
example, substantial energy usage, wear and tear on moving parts, excessive noise,
bulky equipment, and hydrogen embrittlement. Pressurization by thermal cycling is
an alternative to mechanical compression, but like mechanical compression the
energy usage is substantial. In contrast, electrochemical compression is quiet,
scalable, modular, and can achieve high energy efficiency.
          [011] One challenge for electrochemical hydrogen compression is the safety
concern regarding pressurized hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable
and high pressure hydrogen gas raises safety issues. A major concern can include
the leaking or unintended release of the high pressure gas from the electrochemical
compressor. A catastrophic release could pose a safety hazard.
          [012] Moreover, even a small leak that may not rise to the level of a
significant safety concern, nonetheless reduces the efficiency of the electrochemical
compressor. Therefore, there is a need to prevent or reduce hydrogen leakage.
          [013] In consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, the present
disclosure is directed toward an electrochemical cell having a seal configuration
constructed to limit the unintended release of hydrogen from the cell. In addition, the
seal configuration can enable the collection and recycling of hydrogen leaked from
the cell. In certain embodiments disclosed herein, a cascade seal configuration is
contemplated.

wherein the gasket includes one or more plastically deformed portions having one or

wherein the gasket and the sealing surface create a seal about one of the cathode
compartment or the anode compartment.

        [050] Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary
embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the
accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be
                                          -8-

used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Although described
in relation to an electrochemical cell employing hydrogen, it is understood that the
devices and methods of the present disclosure can be employed with various types
of fuel cells and electrochemical cells, including, but not limited to electrolysis cells,
hydrogen purifiers, hydrogen expanders, and hydrogen compressors.
        [051]   FIG. 1 shows an exploded side view of an electrochemical cell 100,
according to an exemplary embodiment.         Electrochemical cell 100 can comprise an
anode 110, a cathode 120, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 130 disposed
in between anode 110 and cathode 120. Anode 110, cathode 120, and PEM 130
combined can comprise a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 140. PEM 130 can
comprise a pure polymer membrane or composite membrane where other material,
for example, silica, heteropolyacids, layered metal phosphates, phosphates, and
zirconium phosphates can be embedded in a polymer matrix. PEM 130 can be
permeable to protons while not conducting electrons. Anode 110 and cathode 120
can comprise porous carbon electrodes containing a catalyst layer. The catalyst
material, for example platinum, can increase the reaction rate.
        [052] Electrochemical cell 100 can further comprise two bipolar plates 150,
160. Bipolar plates 150, 160 can act as support plates, conductors, provide
passages to the respective electrode surfaces for the fuel, and provide passages for
the removal of the compressed fuel. Bipolar plates 150, 160 can also include access
channels for cooling fluid (i.e., water, glycol, or water glycol mixture). The bipolar
plates can be made from aluminum, steel, stainless steel, titanium, copper, Ni-Cr
alloy, graphite or any other electrically conductive material or combination of these
materials in the form of alloys, coatings or claddings. Bipolar plates 150, 160 can
separate electrochemical cell 100 from the neighboring cells in an electrochemical
stack (not shown). For example, multiple electrochemical cells 100 can be linked in
fluidic series to form a multi-stage electrochemical hydrogen compressor (EHC) or
stacked in fluidic parallel to form a single-stage EHC.
        [053] In operation, according to an exemplary embodiment, hydrogen gas
can be supplied to anode 110 through bipolar plate 150. An electric potential can be
applied between anode 110 and cathode 120, wherein the potential at anode 110 is
greater than the potential at cathode 120. The hydrogen at anode 110 can be
oxidized causing the hydrogen to split into electrons and protons. The protons are
electrochemically transported or "pumped" through PEM 130 while the electrons are
                                            -9-

rerouted around PEM 130. At cathode 120 on the opposite side of PEM 130 the
transported protons and rerouted electrons are reduced to form hydrogen. As more
and more hydrogen is formed at cathode 120, the hydrogen can be compressed and
pressurized within a confined space.
            [054] Within electrochemical cell 100, a plurality of different pressure zones
and a plurality of seals can define one or more different pressure zones. FIG. 2A
shows the plurality of different seals and pressure zones within electrochemical cell
100. As shown in FIG. 2A, the plurality of seals can include a first seal 171, a
second seal 181, and a third seal 191. First seal 171 can be contained entirely
within second seal 181 and second seal 181 can be contained entirely within third
seal 191. In addition, the plurality of seals can further include ancillary first seals
175, 176. Ancillary seal 175 and 176 can be located outside first seal 171, but within
second seal 181.
            [055] First seal 171 can define high pressure zone 170 and be configured to
contain a first fluid 172 (e.g., hydrogen) within high pressure zone 170. First seal
171 can delimit the outer boundaries of high pressure zone 170. High pressure zone
170 can correspond to the high pressure cathode 120 side of PEM 130. Hydrogen
formed at cathode 130 can be collected in high pressure zone 170 and contained by
first seal 171. Hydrogen within high pressure zone 170 can be compressed and, as
a result, increase in pressure as more and more hydrogen is formed in high pressure
zone 170. Hydrogen in high pressure zone 170 can be compressed to a pressure up
to or greater than 15,000 psig.
            [056] Ancillary first seals 175, 176 can define two ancillary high pressure
zones 177, 178 that can be in fluid communication with high pressure zone 170.
Ancillary high pressure zones 177, 178 can be common passages configured to
discharge the first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170. Ancillary high pressure
zones 177, 178 can be in fluid communication with common passages of adjacent
electrochemical cells in a multi-cell electrochemical compressor.
            [057] Second seal 181 can define intermediate pressure zone 180 and be
configured to contain a second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure zone 180.
Second seal 181 can delimit the outer boundaries of intermediate pressure zone
180. Intermediate pressure zone 180 can correspond to the low pressure anode 110
side of PEM 130. Second fluid 182 (e.g., hydrogen or gas mixture containing
hydrogen) supplied to anode 110 can be contained in intermediate pressure zone
                                              -10

180 by second seal 181 until it is oxidized and "pumped" across PEM 130 to cathode
120 and high pressure zone 170. Second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure
zone 180 can vary based on the pressure being supplied. Regardless, second fluid
182 in intermediate pressure zone 180 can generally be lower pressure than first
fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170.
        [058] Third seal 191 can define low pressure zone 190 and be configured to
contain a third fluid 192 within low pressure zone 190. Third seal 191 can delimit the
outer boundaries of low pressure zone 190. Low pressure zone 190 can comprise
coolant fluid passages and third fluid 192 can comprise coolant fluid. Coolant fluid
can include water, glycol, or combination thereof. In a high temperature system oil
can be used as a coolant fluid. Third fluid 192 can generally be maintained at a
pressure less than the pressure of second fluid 182 in intermediate pressure zone
180 and first fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170. Low pressure zone 190 can
include an inlet passage and outlet passage (not shown) configured so third fluid 192
can be circulated through low pressure zone 190.
        [059] In an alternate embodiment as shown in FIG. 2B, low pressure zone
190 can be located not within electrochemical cell 100, but rather in the area
surrounding electrochemical cell 100 or a plurality of cells forming a stack. For
example, low pressure zone 190 can contain nitrogen 192 forming a nitrogen blanket
surrounding electrochemical cell 100 or in other embodiments surrounding a stack of
cells. Other inert fluids such as argon or helium could also be used in place of
nitrogen.
        [060] FIG. 3A shows a cross-sectional view of electrochemical cell 100 along
plane A of FIG. 2A. As described in FIG. 2A, electrochemical cell 100 can comprise
MEA 140 and bipolar plates 150, 160. Between bipolar plates 150, 160 can be first
seal 171 defining high pressure zone 170, second seal 181 defining intermediate
pressure zone 180, and third seal 191 defining low pressure zone 190. In FIG. 3A,
first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 can each be shown as two
separate cross-sections of a single continuous seal as previously shown in FIG. 2A.
        [061] As shown in FIG. 3A, first seal 171 can be positioned against a first
shoulder 173. First shoulder 173 can be configured to maintain the position of first
seal 171 as pressure can build within high pressure zone 170. Pressure within high
pressure zone 170 can apply an outward force against first seal 171. The height of
                                          - 11 -

first shoulder 173 can range from about 98% to about 25% of the uncompressed
thickness of first seal 171.
          [062] In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 3A there is no shoulder
located interior to first seal 171. The absence of an interior shoulder as shown in
FIG. 3A can allow for first seal 171 to be combined, joined, connected, or integral to
MEA 140 or portion thereof. Having first seal 171 integral to MEA 140 can facilitate
consistent, efficient, and streamlined assembly of electrochemical cell 100.
However, in alternate embodiments an additional shoulder can be positioned interior
to first seal 171 that can be configured to create a groove in which first seal 171 can
be positioned.
          [063] Referring again to FIG. 3A, second seal 181 can be positioned in a
second groove 183 formed between two shoulders in bipolar plate 160. To the
interior of second groove 183 and second seal 181 can be intermediate pressure
zone 180 and to the exterior of second groove 183 and second seal 181 can be low
pressure zone 190. The depth of second groove 183 can range from about 98% to
about 25% of the uncompressed thickness of second seal 181.
          [064] Third seal 191 as shown in FIG. 3A, can be positioned in a third groove
193 formed between two shoulders in bipolar plate 160. To the interior of third
groove 193 and third seal 191 can be low pressure zone 190 and to the exterior third
groove 193 and third seal 191 can be the surrounding environment of
electrochemical cell 100. The depth of third groove 193 can range from about 98%
to about 25% of the uncompressed thickness of third seal 191.
          [065] During assembly first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191
between bipolar plate 150, 160 can be compressed by a predetermined percentage
of their uncompressed thickness by selecting the appropriate height of their
respective shoulders 173 or depth of their respective grooves, 183 and 193. First
shoulder 173 and the shoulders forming second groove 183 and third groove 193
can act as a stop, as shown in FIG. 3A, for bipolar plate 150. By acting as a stop the
possibility of over compressing the seals can be reduced. The elevation of first
shoulder 173 and the shoulders forming second groove 183 and third groove 193
can be equal, such that, bipolar plate 150 can make contact with all the shoulder
surfaces of bipolar plate 160 at once when the surfaces are parallel.
          [066] In alternate embodiments (not shown), second groove 183 and third
groove 193 can be formed in bipolar plate 150 rather than bipolar plate 160. In
                                           -12

another embodiment, second groove 183 can be formed in either bipolar plate 150,
160 while third groove 193 is formed in the other plate. In yet another embodiment,
portions of second groove 183 and third groove 193 can be formed in both bipolar
plates 150, 160.
            [067] Second groove 183 and third groove 193 can have a cross-sectional
geometry that corresponds to the shape of second seal 181 and third seal 191. For
example, the geometry of the seal and groove cross-section can be a square,
rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle, or oval. In various embodiments the width of
second seal 181 and third seal 191 can be less than the corresponding groove. The
additional space in the grooves can allow for the expanding and contracting of the
seals caused by temperature change, pressure change from the internal gases, and
pressure change from the bipolar plate compression. As shown in FIG. 3A, typically
the seals can be forced outwardly to the outer most position within the grooves
because the seals experience higher pressure from the interior side versus the
exterior side.
            [068] First seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 can be a gasket, o
ring, or other sealing component. First seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191
can be made of an elastomeric or polymeric sealing material, for example, silicone,
EPDM (ethylenepropylene-diene-monomer), fluoroelastomer, nitrile rubber (Buna-N),
PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), polysulfone, polyetherimide, polychenylene sulfide,
PEEK (polyether ether ketone), polyimide , PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN
(polyethylene naphthalate), HDPE (high-density polyethylene), polyurethane,
neoprene, acetal, nylon, polybutylene terephthalate, NBR (acrylonitrile-butadiene
rubber), etc. In some embodiments, first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal
191 can be made from metal material including, for example, tin, tin alloys, stainless
steel, silver, platinum, and gold. The material of each seal can be different than the
material of the other seals, the material can be the same for just two of the seals, or
the material can be the same for all the seals.
            [069] Like the material, the thickness of each seal can be different than the
other seals. Thickness can be measured along a vertical axis (Y) of electrochemical
cell 100. As shown in FIG. 3A, the thickness of second seal 181 is greater than the
thickness of first seal 171 and the thickness of third seal 191 is greater than the
thickness of second seal 181. Consequently, the outermost seal, third seal 191, can
have the greatest thickness and the innermost seal, first seal 171, can have the
                                              -13
104728061 (GHMatters) P102084.AU.1

smallest thickness. For example, the thickness of first seal 171 can range between
about 0.01 mm and about 1.0 mm, the thickness of second seal 181 can range
between about 0.02 mm and about 2.0 mm, and the thickness of third seal 191 can
range between about 0.03 mm and 3.0 mm.
            [070] For embodiments where the cross-sectional geometry of first seal 171,
second seal 181, and third seal 191 can be a circle or oval, the thickness as
described above can refer to the diameter of the circle or oval cross-section.
            [071] As shown in FIG. 3B, during operation of electrochemical cell 100, the
pressure of first fluid 172, second fluid 182, and third fluid 192 applied within each
corresponding zone between bipolar plates 150, 160 can produce an opening force
200. Opening force 200 unopposed can cause bipolar plate 150, 160 to separate.
In order to prevent opening force 200 from separating bipolar plates 150, 160, a
closing force 210 can be applied to the plates to oppose and overcome opening
force 200. It is understood that the pressure of first fluid 172, second fluid 182, and
third fluid 192 would produce more forces than those represented by the plurality of
arrows representing opening force 200. For example, lateral forces (not shown)
perpendicular to opening force 200 would be produced as well as other forces
pointing outwardly from each pressure zone in all possible directions.
            [072] FIG. 4A shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a first
configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can maintain first configuration when closing
force 210 is sufficient to overcome opening force 200 and hold bipolar plates 150,
160 substantially together. While in first configuration first seal 171, second seal
181, and third seal 191 can all maintain contact with both the top and bottom sealing
surfaces of bipolar plate 150, 160, preventing leaking or bypassing of first fluid 172,
second fluid 182, or third fluid 192. In this particular situation, all seals are fulfilling
their function.
            [073] When electrochemical cell 100 is in first configuration, as described
above, the actual measurement of the separation between the surfaces of bipolar
plates 150, 160 can vary. For example, the separation can range from about 0.00
mm to about 0.01 mm, to about 0.05 mm, to about 0.10 mm.
            [074] FIG. 4B shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a second
configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can change to second configuration when
closing force 210 is reduced or opening force 200 is increased (e.g., first fluid 172
pressure increases) causing bipolar plates 150, 160 to separate. As shown in FIG.
                                            - 14
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

4B, the first separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause first seal 171 to unseat
allowing the bypass of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 into intermediate
pressure zone 180. In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 4B, first seal 171 is
shown to unseat from bipolar plate 160 first, allowing the flow of first fluid 172 under
and around first seal 171. However, it is understood that in alternate embodiments
(not shown), first seal 171 can unseat from bipolar plate 150 first, allowing the flow of
first fluid 172 over first seal 171 by passing between first seal 171 and MEA 140.
            [075] The flow of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 to intermediate
pressure zone 180 can be caused by the pressure differential between first fluid 172
and second fluid 182 and may travel along the path of least resistance. First seal
171 can be configured to be the first of the seals to unseat by having a thickness
less than second seal 181 and third seal 191. This can allow third seal 191 and
second seal 181 to maintain contact with both sealing surfaces preventing fluid from
bypassing either seal despite the first separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 present in
second configuration.
            [076] When electrochemical cell 100 is in second configuration, as described
above, the actual measurement of the first separation that exists between bipolar
plates 150, 160 can vary. For example, first separation can range from about 0.01
mm to about 0.05 mm, to about 0.10 mm, to about 0.25 mm.
            [077] FIG. 4C shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a third
configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can change to third configuration when
closing force 210 is further reduced or opening force 200 is further increased causing
bipolar plates 150, 160 to undergo second separation. As shown in FIG. 4C, second
separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause both first seal 171 and second seal
181 to unseat allowing the bypass of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 and
second fluid 182 from intermediate pressure zone 180 into low pressure zone 190.
In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 4C, second seal 181 is shown to unseat
from bipolar plate 150 first, allowing the flow of second fluid 182 over second seal
181. However, it is understood that in alternate embodiments (not shown), second
seal 181 can unseat from bipolar plate 160 first, allowing the flow of second fluid 182
under and around second seal 181.
            [078] The flow of second fluid 182 from intermediate pressure zone 180 to
low pressure zone 190 can be caused by the pressure differential between second
fluid 182 and third fluid 192. Second seal 181 can be configured to be the second
                                                -15
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

seal to unseat by being thicker than first seal 171, but not as thick as third seal 191.
Therefore, because third seal 191 can be thicker than both first seal 171 and second
seal 181, third seal 191 can maintain contact with both sealing surfaces preventing
flow from bypassing notwithstanding the second separation of bipolar plates 150,
160.
            [079] When electrochemical cell 100 is in third configuration, as described
above, the actual measurement of the second separation can vary. For example,
second separation can range from about 0.05 mm to about 0.25 mm, to about 0. 50
mm.
            [080] Electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to transition from first
configuration to second configuration and second configuration to third configuration
based on the changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200 during
operation. In addition, electrochemical cell 100 can also transition from third
configuration to second configuration and second configuration to first configuration
based on the changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200. It is
contemplated that transitioning between first configuration, second configuration, and
third configuration can occur continuously during the operation in response to the
changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200.
            [081] In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the modulus of elasticity
or durometer of the seals can be different instead of the thickness of the seals to
enable the dispersed unseating of the seals. In yet another embodiment, both the
thickness and the modulus of elasticity can be varied.
            [082] In certain embodiments, arrangement of the seals as described above
can be classified as a cascade seal configuration. The cascade seal configuration
can provide several advantages. For example, the cascade seal configuration can
limit the potential of high pressure hydrogen escaping electrochemical cell 100 by
providing seal redundancy in the form of three levels of sealing protection. Reducing
the potential of hydrogen leaks can benefit safety and energy efficiency.
            [083] In addition, the cascade seal configuration can also allow for self
regulation of pressure. Self-regulation of pressure can be achieved because of the
disparity in seal thickness and the resulting dispersed unseating of first seal 171,
second seal 181, and third seal 191. For example, when electrochemical cell 100 is
in second configuration as shown in FIG. 4B, first seal 171 can unseat allowing first
fluid 172 to leak into intermediate pressure zone 180. First fluid 172 leaking into
                                             -16
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

intermediate pressure zone 180 can bleed pressure from high pressure zone 170.
By bleeding pressure from high pressure zone 170, opening force 200 can be
reduced. The drop in opening force 200 can allow the first separation of bipolar
plates 150, 160 to be reversed causing the transition of electrochemical cell 100 from
second configuration to first configuration and the reseating of first seal 171.
          [084] First fluid 172 that leaks by first seal 171 can combine with second fluid
182 and be utilized by electrochemical cell 100, in effect, the leaked first fluid 172
can be recycled. A consequence of this leaking and subsequent recycling can be a
loss in compression efficiency because the leaked hydrogen is "pumped" through
PEM 130 twice. However, the potential loss in compression efficiency is still less
than the overall loss in efficiency would be if the leaked hydrogen was not recovered
an instead leaked to the exterior of electrochemical cell 100 and was lost.
          [085] In the event the bleeding of pressure from high pressure zone 170 is
not enough to cause the transition from second configuration to first configuration,
second separation may occur causing electrochemical cell to transition from second
configuration to third configuration. In third configuration as shown in FIG. 4C, the
second separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause second seal 181 to unseat
allowing second fluid 182 to leak into low pressure zone 190. Second fluid 182
leaking into low pressure zone 190 can bleed pressure from intermediate pressure
zone 180. By bleeding pressure from intermediate pressure zone 180, opening force
200 can be further reduced. The drop in opening force 200 can allow the second
separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 to be reversed causing the transition of
electrochemical cell 100 from third configuration to second configuration and the
reseating of at least second seal 181.
          [086] The consequence of bleeding second fluid 182 from intermediate
pressure zone 180 to low pressure zone 190 can be a loss of cell efficiency.
However, a benefit can be reducing the possibility of second fluid 182 (i.e., hydrogen
gas) from escaping electrochemical cell 100.
          [087] In various embodiments, the pressure of third fluid 192 in low pressure
zone 190 can be monitored. The unseating of second seal 181 can result in a
pressure increase in low pressure zone 190 caused by the bleeding of second fluid
182 pressure into low pressure zone 190. Therefore, by monitoring the pressure of
third fluid 192 the unseating of second seal 181 can be detected. In addition,
electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to shut down before the pressure in low
                                             -17
1A72RA 1/     Dl-PAAA All i

pressure zone 190 reaches a critical pressure. The critical pressure can be set just
below the pressure at which third seal 191 would unseat allowing first fluid 172,
second fluid 182, and third fluid 192 to escape electrochemical cell 100.
          [088] Monitoring the pressure can be accomplished in a variety of means.
For example, a pressure transmitter could be configured to read the pressure in
intermediate or low pressure zones 180 or 190, respectively, and when the pressure
reaches the critical pressure set point the electrical potential to anode 110 and
cathode 120 could be turned off preventing further hydrogen from getting "pumped"
across PEM 130.
          [089] In other embodiments, the pressure of second fluid 182 in intermediate
pressure zone 180 and first fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170 can also be
monitored. For example, monitoring the pressure of second fluid 182 can allow the
cell to be shut down before the pressure reaches the point where second seal 181
could unseat.
          [090] In various embodiments, when first fluid 172 or second fluid 182 (e.g.,
high or low pressure hydrogen) bleeds into low pressure zone 190 it can combine
with third fluid 192 (e.g., coolant fluid) and can be carried out of low pressure zone
190 by the circulating third fluid 192.
          [091] FIG. 5 shows an electrochemical hydrogen reclamation system (EHRS)
500, according to an exemplary embodiment. EHRS 500 can comprise an
electrochemical cell 100 as described above having a cascade seal configuration. In
addition to electrochemical cell 100, EHRS 500 can comprise a hydrogen
reclamation apparatus 510. Apparatus 510 can be in fluid communication with low
pressure zone 190 and intermediate pressure zone 180 of electrochemical cell 100.
Apparatus 510 can receive third fluid 192 discharged from low pressure zone 190
and can be configured to recover at least a portion of any second fluid 182 contained
in third fluid 192. After third fluid 192 passes through hydrogen reclamation
apparatus 510, third fluid can be resupplied to low pressure zone 190. Any second
fluid 182 recovered from third fluid 192 by hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can
be reintroduced into intermediate pressure zone 180 by way of a recycle line 520
configured to fluidly connect hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 and intermediate
pressure zone 180. Recycling second fluid 182 can improve overall system
efficiency. When second fluid 182 is hydrogen gas, for example, recycling second
fluid 182 reduces the amount of new hydrogen required.

1A72RA 1/     Dl-PAAA All i

          [092] Hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can use a variety of technologies
to separate second fluid 182 from third fluid 192. For example, dissolved gas
separation from liquid coolant or hydrogen separation membrane from a nitrogen
blanket.
          [093] In various embodiments, EHRS 500 can be configured to monitor the
pressure of third fluid 192 in low pressure zone 190. By monitoring the pressure of
third fluid 192 in low pressure zone 190, hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can be
configured to only be engaged or energized when an increased pressure has been
detected, which can indicate second seal 182 has unseated and second fluid has
leaked into low pressure zone 190. By limiting the use of hydrogen reclamation
apparatus the overall system efficiency can be increased.
          [094] Electrochemical cell 100 can operate at differential pressures higher
than about 15,000 psig. For example, a differential pressure can be measured as
the difference between second fluid 182 pressure (i.e., the inlet hydrogen pressure)
which can range from about -10 psig to about 0 psig, or from about 0 psig to about
25 psig, about 100 psig, about 500 psig, about 1,000 psig, or about 6,000 psig and
first fluid 172 pressure (i.e., compressed hydrogen pressure) which can range from
the lower bound of the inlet hydrogen pressure to higher than about 15,000 psig.
The differential pressure as described above can be the differential pressure
experienced by first seal 171. Second seal 181 can experience differential pressure
between second fluid 182 and third fluid 192 ranging between about 0 psig to about
25 psig, about 100 psig, about 500 psig, about 1,000 psig, or about 6,000 psig.
          [095] The cascade seal configuration describe above can enable closing
force 210 to be tuned (i.e., increased or decreased) to a particular opening force
200. Traditionally closing force 210 can be set to deliver a preload on first seal 171,
second seal 181, and third seal 191 sufficient to withstand the expected opening
force 200 caused by the internal pressure. However, by changing the preload or
adjusting closing force 210 during operation of electrochemical cell 100, the pressure
at which first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 unseat can be tuned so
they each unseat and leak at a preferred particular pressure.
          [096] The tuning capability of electrochemical cell 100 can be used to
enhance the safety of the device. As described above, unseating of the seals
enables the bleeding of high pressure and the reseating of the seals. Therefore, by
tuning closing force 210, electrochemical cell can be configured so that the seals are
                                            -19

the first component to react to a pressure increase instead of another component
that's failure could result in release of hydrogen.
          [097] FIG. 6 shows a flow chart 600, for a method of tuning the seals of
electrochemical cell 100. The method can include providing electrochemical cell
100, which can have a plurality of seals in a cascade seal configuration as described
above. Next, the method can include applying an initial closing force to the
electrochemical cell based on the expected operating pressure. After applying an
initial closing force the cell can be energized and operation can begin. During
operation the pressure of the low, intermediate, and high pressure zones within
electrochemical cell 100 can be monitored continuously or intermittently. Based on
the monitored pressures and the resulting opening force the closing force can be
adjusted. Adjusting the closing force can change the pressure at which at least one
of the plurality of seals unseats. This process can continue throughout the operation
of the electrochemical cell or can be configured to run for only a finite period of time
initially at startup. As required, operation of electrochemical cell can be ended.
          [098] It is contemplated that, in some embodiments, first seal 171 can unseat
due to the pressure of first fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170 without separation of
plates 150, 160. Similarly, it is contemplated that both first seal 171 and second seal
181 can unseat due to the pressure of first fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170 and
second fluid 182 in intermediate pressure zone 182 without separation of plates 150,
160. In these embodiments, pressure of at least first fluid 172 and, in certain
embodiments, both first fluid 172 and second fluid 182 can be monitored. Based on
the monitored pressures, the closing force can be adjusted. Closing force 210 can
be further tuned based on the geometry and/or thickness of first seal 171, second
seal 181, and third seal 191 relative to first shoulder 173, second groove 183, and
third groove 193, respectively.
          [099] More or fewer seals and pressure zones are contemplated. For
example, in another embodiment as shown in FIG. 7, electrochemical cell 100 can
comprise a first seal 171 and second seal 181. Accordingly, electrochemical cell 100
as shown in FIG. 7 can comprise a first seal 171 defining a high pressure zone 170.
First seal 171 can be located between the bipolar plates 150, 160 and configured to
contain a first fluid 172 with high pressure zone 170. Electrochemical cell 100 can
further comprise a second seal 181 defining an intermediate pressure zone 180.
Second seal 182 can be located between bipolar plates 150, 160 and configured to

contain second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure zone 180. First seal 171 can
be contained entirely with second seal 181. Electrochemical cell 100 can further
comprise ancillary first seals 175, 176. Ancillary seal 175 and 176 can be located
outside first seal 171, but within second seal 181.
            [0100] In addition, with regard to electrochemical cell 100, first fluid 172 can
be at a higher pressure than second fluid 182. First seal 171 and second seal 181
can have a generally rectangular cross-section. The thickness of second seal 181
can be greater than first seal 171. First seal 171 can be configured to leak first fluid
172 into intermediate pressure zone 180 when first seal 171 unseats. In such an
embodiment, electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to shutdown prior to the
unseating of second seal 181 reducing the possibility of second fluid 182 leaking
from intermediate pressure zone 180.
            [0101] First seal 171 and second seal 181 within electrochemical cell 100 can
be configured to remain seated preventing the leaking of first fluid 172 and second
fluid 182 when a closing force being applied to bipolar plates 150, 160 is greater than
the opening force within bipolar plates 150, 160. When closing force applied to
bipolar plates 150, 160 approaches the opening force within bipolar plates 150, 160,
first seal 171 can be configured to unseat before second seal 181 unseats causing
first fluid 172 to leak past first seal 171 into intermediate pressure zone 180. First
fluid 172 that leaks past first seal 171 can combine with second fluid 182 and be
recycled.
            [0102] In another example (not shown), electrochemical cell 100 can comprise
first seal 171, second seal 181, third seal 191, and a fourth seal. In this example, the
fourth seal can be contained entirely within third seal 191, between second seal 181
and third seal 191. That is, the fourth seal can define a fourth pressure zone which
can be, for example, a vacuum or hydrogen reclamation zone containing a fluid
having a pressure that is lower than the pressure of both second fluid 182 and third
fluid 192. The fourth seal can have a thickness that is greater than the thickness of
second seal 181. In this manner, second seal 181 can be configured to leak second
fluid 182 into the fourth pressure zone when second seal 181 unseats.
            [0103] FIGS. 8 and 11 illustrate exemplary embodiments of first seal 171. As
discussed above, first seal 171 defines high pressure zone 170, which can be
configured to contain a first fluid 172 (e.g., hydrogen) within high pressure zone 170.
High pressure zone 170 can correspond to the high pressure cathode side 120 of
                                               - 21
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

PEM 130. Hydrogen formed at cathode 120 can be collected in high pressure zone
170 and contained by first seal 171. In some embodiments, hydrogen in high
pressure zone 170 can have a pressure greater than 15,000 psig.
            [0104] As will be discussed in more detail below, first seal 171 can include
an assembly of components capable of sealing a compartment of electrochemical
cell 100, and withstanding pressures in excess of 15,000 psig for long periods of
time (e.g., greater than 10 years) and withstand many pressure cycles (e.g., greater
than 10,000 cycles). In the exemplary embodiments, the sealing components
including a gasket 300; a sealing surface 350 formed in one of bipolar plate 150,
160; and PEM 130. First seal 171 can be formed by compression of gasket 300
against sealing surface 350, and compression of PEM 130 against gasket 300.
Other seals can include one or more features below and may be used in conjunction
with first seal 171. Additionally, it will be understood that the features described
below can be used to seal other components of the electrochemical cell and/or can
be used in cells that to not employ the cascade seal configuration.
            [0105] FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view of electrochemical cell 100, according
to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in FIG. 8, electrochemical cell 100
includes an anode 110 compartment, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 130, and
a cathode compartment 120 disposed between bipolar plates 150, 160. Sealing
surface 350 can be formed in one of bipolar plates 150, 160, and located adjacent a
perimeter of the compartment to be sealed. In FIG. 8, sealing surface 350 is located
outside a perimeter of cathode compartment 120. Gasket 300 is positioned between
sealing surface 350 and PEM 130.
            [0106] During assembly of electrochemical cell 100, gasket 300 can be
compressed against sealing surface 350 of bipolar plate 160 and PEM 130 to form
first seal 171, second seal 181, or third seal 191. Gasket 300 can be configured
such that, under compression by sealing surface 350, gasket 300 primarily
undergoes plastic deformation. In particular, gasket 300 can be made from a "hard"
material with a creep modulus and compressive yield strength greater than the
required sealing pressure, but lower than the compressive yield strength of sealing
surface 350. For example, gasket 300 can be made from a material having a creep
modulus and/or compressive yield strength in a range sufficient to withstand
pressure greater than 12,000 psi. Gasket 300 can have a yield strength higher than
PEM 130, so that a seal is formed by compression of the soft PEM material against
                                             - 22
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

the surface of the hard gasket material. Alternately, gasket 300 can be made of a
material having a compressive yield strength less than the required sealing pressure.
A compressive pressure greater than the required sealing pressure is still able to be
applied to gasket 300 due to the gasket being constrained by the wall of bipolar plate
160 and the protrusions on sealing surface 350.
            [0107] In some embodiments, gasket 300 can be made of a polymeric
sealing material including, but not limited to, Torlon@, polyether ether ketone
(PEEK), polyethyleneimine (PEI), polycarbonate, polyimide, PET (polyethylene
terephthalate), PEN (polyethylene naphthalate), HDPE (high-density polyethylene),
polyurethane, acetal, nylon, polybutylene terephthalate and polysulfone. The
polymer gasket materials can be acid resistant and should not leach materials that
are harmful to the operation of electrochemical cell 100. In other embodiments,
gasket 300 can be made from metal material including, but not limited to, tin, tin
alloys, stainless steel, silver, platinum, and gold. The metal gasket materials can be
corrosion resistant or have a corrosion resistant coating. In yet other embodiments,
gasket 300 can be made of a composite of polymeric and/or metallic materials.
            [0108] The dimensions of gasket 300 including the shape, thickness, and
width of gasket 300 can vary, and can be based on the dimensions of
electrochemical cell 100. In some embodiments, gasket 300 can have a
substantially rectilinear cross-section with a thickness in the range of 0.25 inches to
0.001 inches. The thickness is measured along a vertical axis (Y) of cell. In these
embodiments, gasket 300 can have a width to thickness aspect ratio in the range of
3:1 to more than 25:1.
            [0109] Sealing surface 350 can include one or more features configured to
apply sufficient pressure to plastically deform gasket 300 and create a seal. For
example, sealing surface 350 can be a surface having one or more protrusions 360.
In certain embodiments, compressive forces are applied to create sufficient stresses
that cause the gasket to plastically deform and create a sealing surface. The
protrusions 360 can function as stress concentrators and when pressed into the seal,
and can create localized stress in the material higher than a target sealing pressure.
Although three protrusions 360 are depicted, it will be understood that a greater or
lesser number of protrusions may be provided.
            [0110] The protrusions can have any known geometry, sufficient to deform
gasket 300. For example, the protrusions can have a triangular configuration 360a
                                            -23
104728061 (GHMatters) P102084.AU.1

(FIG. 9A), a cusp configuration 360b (FIG. 9B), or a flat blade configuration 360c
(FIG. 9C). Other contemplated geometries for the protrusions include a partially
rounded configuration, and a semicircular configuration. It is contemplated that the
configuration of each protrusion can be different than the configuration of the other
protrusions, or the same for all the protrusions. In figures 9A-C the exemplary
protrusions are shown having the same height, but any one or more of could be
configured to be taller or shorter than the rest. For example, every other protrusion
may have the same height, the outer most protrusions may be taller and at the same
height, the one or more inner protrusions may be taller, the protrusions may descend
or ascend in height moving from left to right or right to left, or every protrusion may
be at a different height. Embodiments having protrusions of different heights may be
configured to better account for variability in machining tolerances of the other
components.
            [0111] Protrusions 360 and gasket 300 can be positioned relative to each
other to leave a small gap between protrusions 360 and a top surface of a portion of
gasket 300. During assembly, protrusions 360 can be compressed against gasket
300 causing each protrusion 360 to press into and seal with gasket 300. As further
compressive forces are applied to bipolar plates 150, 160, sufficient stresses can be
formed to cause gasket 300 to plastically deform and create a seal.
            [0112] In the exemplary embodiment, sealing surface can be a knife edge
sealing surface having one or more protrusions machined to a sharp knife edge.
During assembly, these protrusions can be compressed against gasket 300 causing
the knife edge of each protrusion to press into and seal with gasket 300. As further
compressive forces are applied to bipolar plates 150, 160, sufficient stresses can be
formed to cause gasket 300 to plastically deform and create a seal.
            [0113] Gasket 300 can be compressed by a predetermined percentage of its
uncompressed thickness by selecting the appropriate height and width dimensions
for protrusions 360. In certain embodiments, protrusions 360 can be arranged so as
to deliberately create a non-uniform stress field within the gasket, where portions of
the stress field are greater in magnitude than the level of gas pressure being sealed.
            [0114] FIGS. 9D and 9E provide a cross-section view of the sealing surface of
a biopolar plate depicted in FIG. 9A, in an uncompressed and compressed state,
respectively. In FIG 9D, the width of gasket 300 is represented by      WG1,  the height of
gasket 300 is represented by hG1, and the pocket depth in bipolar plate 160 is
                                           - 24

represented by dp. With respect to protrusions 360, the height is represented by ht,
the spacing between the protrusions 360 is represented by St.
            [0115] In certain embodiments, the ratio of hGl:dp can range from 0.8:1 to
1.5:1, such as from 0.9:1 to 1.3:1, 0.9:1 to 1.4:1, from 1:1 to 1.3:1, and from 1:1 to
1.2:1. In addition, the ratio of ht:hGl can range from 0.05:1 to 0.75:1, such as from
0.1:1 to 0.7:1, from 0.15:1 to 0.65:1, from 0.2:1 to 0.6:1 and from 0.25:1 to 0.6:1.
Further, the ratio of St:ht can range from 0.5:1 to 10:1 such as from 0.1:1 to 10:1,
from 0.2:1 to 8:1, from 0.5:1 to 6:1, and from 1:1 to 5:1. In further embodiments, the
ratio of hGl:dp, ht:hGl, and St:ht can all be within at least one range disclosed above.
            [0116] In FIG 9E, the width of gasket 300 is represented by WG2, the height of
gasket 300 is represented by                  hG2, and, in this embodiment in which the gasket is
compressed, the pocket depth dp in bipolar plate 160 is equal to                  hG2. In this
embodiment, the pocket width is represented by Wp.
            [0117] In certain embodiments, the ratio of WG1:Wp ranges from 0.25:1 to 2:1
such as from 0.5:1 to 2:1, from 0.75:1 to 2:1, from 1:1 to 2:1, and from 0.25:1 to 1:1.
In addition, the ratio of Wp:St can range from 1:1 to 20:1, such as from 1:1 to 15:1,
from 1:1 to 10:1, from 5:1 to 20:1, and from 5:1 to 10:1. In further embodiments, the
ratio of WG1:Wp and Wp:St can all be within at least one range disclosed above.
            [0118]             FIG. 9F illustrates a set of protrusions 360 having be a certain height
ht, spaced a certain distance St from one another, and the sloped sides of each
protrusion can form an angle a. According to various embodiments, the height of the
protrusions 360 can range from 0.001 to 0.020 inches, such as from 0.003 to 0.020
inches, from 0.005 to 0.015 inches, and from 0.006 to 0.010 inches. According to
various embodiments, the distance between protrusions can range from 0.01 to 0.2
inches, such as from 0.05 to 0.1 inches, from 0.02 to 0.05 inches, and from 0.02 to
0.03 inches. According to various embodiment, angle a can range from 55 to 125
degrees, such as from 60 to 120 degrees, from 65 to 115 degrees, from 75 to 105
degrees, and from 80 degrees to 100 degrees. In further embodiments, the height of
the protrusions, distance between the protrusions, and angle of the protrusions can
all be within at least one range disclosed above.
            [0119] In alternative embodiments, sealing surface 350' can be provided on
gasket 300' (FIG. 10) instead of one of the bipolar plates. According to this
embodiment, bipolar plate 160 can have a flat surface, and the portion of gasket 300'
in contact with bipolar plate 160 can have sealing surface 350' including protrusions
                                                         -25
104728061 (GHMatters) P102084.AU.1

360'. As in the embodiment described above, protrusions 360' can be machined to a
sharp knife edge. Upon assembly of electrochemical cell 100, sealing surface 350'
can be compressed against bipolar plate 160 to plastically deform protrusions 360' of
gasket 300'. As these protrusions plastically deform, the knife edge of each
protrusion can press into and seal with sealing surface 350'.
            [0120] Referring back to FIG. 8, PEM 130 can be compressed against a side
of gasket 300 that is opposite of sealing surface 350. In the exemplary embodiment,
PEM 130 can be formed of a material having a yield strength that is lower (e.g.,
softer) than gasket 300. In this arrangement, a seal is formed by the compression of
the soft PEM material against the surface of the hard gasket material.
            [0121] In alternative embodiments, a membrane or a membrane-like material
can be provided on at least one side of gasket 300. For example, a membrane or
membrane-like material 370 can be provided between bipolar plate 160 and gasket
300 (FIG. 11). In some embodiments, membrane 370 can also be provided between
gasket 300 and PEM 130 (e.g., on both sides of gasket 300).
            [0122] Membrane 370 can be a "soft gasket," used in place of the knife-edge
seal. In particular, membrane 370 can be formed of a "soft" material having a creep
modulus and compressive yield strength that is lower than gasket 300. A seal can
be formed by compression of membrane 370 against gasket 300 and bipolar plate
160. Where a membrane 370 is provided on both sides of gasket 300, a seal can
also be formed by compression of membrane 370 against gasket 300 and PEM 130.
            [0123] In some embodiments, membrane 370 can be bonded to gasket 300
by adhesive materials or other known bonding methods. Such methods include hot
pressing or ultrasonic welding. Bonding of membrane 370 to gasket 300 can aid in
assembly of electrochemical cell 100, and can improve the seal between membrane
370 and gasket 300.
            [0124] In some embodiments, the perimeter of anode compartment 110 can
extend beyond the perimeter of the sealed cathode compartment 120 (FIGS. 12A
12D). In those embodiments, a thin gas diffusion layer 380 can be provided between
PEM 130 and the portion of anode compartment 110 that extends beyond the
perimeter of cathode compartment 120. In the exemplary embodiment shown in
FIGS. 12A-12D, gas diffusion layer 380 is disposed along a side of PEM 130 that is
opposite to gasket 300.
                                            - 26
1A72RA 1 /C   -I iAn-re A All i

            [0125] Gas diffusion layer 380 can serve as diffusion media enabling the
transport of gases and liquids within the cell, can aid in the removal of heat and
process water from the cell, and in some cases, can provide some mechanical
support to PEM 130. Gas diffusion layer 380 can comprise a woven or non-woven
carbon or other conductive material cloth. In certain embodiments, "frit"-type densely
sintered metals, screen packs, expanded metals, metal foam, or three-dimensional
porous metallic substrates can be used in combination with or as a replacement for
at least a portion of gas diffusion layer 380 to provide structural support.
            [0126] Also included in these embodiments is a reinforcement layer 385,
which can have any size, shape, and/or configuration sufficient to provide support to
PEM 130. Reinforcement layer 385 can be configured to prevent extrusion or
tearing of PEM 130 due to excessive stress caused by the non-uniform flow fields.
In certain embodiments, reinforcement layer 385 is formed from a polyester resin.
            [0127] In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 12A and 12C,
reinforcement layer 385 has a length dimension that is substantially the same as
gasket 300. In other exemplary embodiments shown in FIGS. 12B and 12D,
reinforcement layer 385 has a length that is greater than a length of gasket 300, e.g.,
a portion of reinforcement layer 385 extends beyond an edge of gasket 300. In the
embodiments shown in FIGS. 12B and 12D, reinforcement layer 385 provides
support to PEM 130 in the event PEM 130 bends at the edge of gasket 300.
            [0128] In various embodiments, the sealing engagement between gasket
300, sealing surface 350, and PEM 130, can be tested ex-situ before assembly of
electrochemical cell 100 without loss of integrity of the seal. In particular, a shim 390
can be placed between bipolar plates 150, 160 to prevent full compression of gasket
300 during ex-situ testing. This can ensure that gasket 300 experiences a high
stress at sealing surface 350 when fully compressed in the stack. In the exemplary
embodiment shown in FIG. 13, shim 390 is shown between bipolar plates 150, 160
to increase the depth of seal 171 and prevent full deformation of the gasket 300
during ex-situ testing.
            [0129] The seal assembly described above can provide several advantages.
While conventional elastomeric seals require less compressive force, the elastomeric
seals are susceptible to extrusion and explosive decompression. The disclosed
gasket 300, in contrast, can be more resilient. As noted above, the disclosed gasket
300 can be selected to be softer than sealing surface 350 and harder than PEM 130.
                                             - 27

Accordingly, gasket 300 can be capable of sealing pressures in excess of 15,000
psi. Additionally, gasket 300 can provide a greater dimensional tolerance in the flow
field thicknesses and pocket depths than conventional sealing designs. As gasket
300 can deform over a relatively large range of thicknesses, gasket 300 can
accommodate variations in pocket depths and flow fields while still maintaining
relatively uniform compression pressure.
            [0130] FIG. 14 shows one embodiment of bipolar plates 150 and 160
comprising a two-piece bipolar plate 800 comprising a first component 801 and a
second component 802 configured for a cascade seal configuration. First
component 801 can form a void 803 in fluid communication with a flow structure 805.
            [0131] Electrochemical cell 100, as shown in FIG. 1, can further comprise
electrically-conductive gas diffusion layers within electrochemical cell 100 on each
side of MEA 140. Gas diffusion layers can serve as diffusion media enabling the
transport of gases and liquids within the cell, provide electrical conduction between
bipolar plates 150 and 160 and PEM 130, aid in the removal of heat and process
water from the cell, and in some cases, provide mechanical support to PEM 140. In
addition, channels (not shown), known as flow fields, in bipolar plates 150 and 160
can be configured to supply gases to anode 110 and cathode 120 of MEA 140.
Reactant gases on each side of PEM 130 can flow through flow fields and diffuse
through the porous gas diffusion layers. The flow fields and the gas diffusion layers
can be positioned contiguously and coupled by the internal fluid streams.
Accordingly, the flow field and the gas diffusion layers can collectively form flow
structure 805.
            [0132] First component 801 and second component 802 can be generally flat
and have a generally rectangular profile. In other embodiments, components 801
and 802 can have a profile shaped like a square, a "race-track" (i.e., a substantially
rectangular shape with semi-elliptical later sides), circle, oval, elliptical, or other
shape. The shape of first component 801 and second component 802 can
correspond to the other components of electrochemical cell 100 (e.g., cathode,
anode, PEM, flow structure, etc.) or electrochemical cell stack.
            [0133] First component 801 and second component 802 can each be formed
of one or more materials. First component 801 and second component 802 can be
formed of the same materials or different materials. Component 801 and 802 can be
                                             - 28

formed of a metal, such as, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, nickel, iron, etc., or a
metal alloy, such as, nickel chrome alloy, nickel-tin alloy, or a combination thereof.
            [0134] First component 801 and second component 802 can comprise a clad
material, for example, aluminum clad with stainless steel on one or more regions.
Cladding can provide the advantages of both metals, for example, in the case of a
bipolar plate fabricated from stainless steel-clad aluminum, the stainless steel
protects the aluminum core from corrosion during cell operation, while providing the
superior material properties of aluminum, such as, high strength-to-weight ratio, high
thermal and electrical conductivity, etc. In other embodiments, first component 801
can comprise anodized, sealed, and primed aluminum. Other coatings such as paint
or powder coat could be used with component 801.
            [0135] In some embodiments, first component 801 can be formed of a
composite, such as, carbon fiber, graphite, glass-reinforced polymer, thermoplastic
composites. In some embodiments, first component 801 can be formed of a metal
which is coated to prevent both corrosion and electrical conduction.
            [0136] According to various embodiments, first component 801 can be
generally non-conductive reducing the likelihood of shorting between the
electrochemical cells. Second component 802 can be formed of one or more
materials that provide electrical conductivity as well as corrosion resistance during
cell operation. For example, second component 802 can be configured to be
electrically conductive in the region where the active cell components sit (e.g., flow
structure, MEA, etc.).
            [0137] First component 801 and second component 802 can be configured for
coplanar coupling. First component 801 and second component 802 can be
releasably coupled or fixedly coupled. One or more attachment mechanisms can be
used including, for example, bonding material, welding, brazing, soldering, diffusion
bonding, ultrasonic welding, laser welding, stamping, riveting, resistance welding, or
sintering. In some embodiments, the bonding material may include an adhesive.
Suitable adhesives include, for example, glues, epoxies, cyanoacrylates,
thermoplastic sheets (including heat bonded thermoplastic sheets) urethanes,
anaerobic, UV-cure, and other polymers. In some embodiments, first component 801
and second component 802 can be coupled by a friction fit. For example, one or

          [0138] In other embodiments, first component 801 and second component
802 can be releasably coupled using fasteners, for example, screws, bolts, clips, or
other similar mechanisms. In other embodiments, compression rods and nuts or
other, similar mechanical compression system can pass through bipolar plate 800 or
along the outside and be used to compress first component 801 and second
component 802 together as electrochemical cell 100 or a plurality of electrochemical
cells 100 are compressed in a stack.
          [0139] Coupled first component 801 and second component 802 can form a
plurality of different pressure zones and a plurality of seals can define one or more
different pressure zones. FIG. 14 shows the plurality of different seals and pressure
zones. As shown in FIG. 14, the plurality of seals can include a first seal 871, a
second seal 881, and a third seal 891. First seal 871 can be contained entirely
within second seal 881 and second seal 881 can be contained entirely within third
seal 891. The shape of first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891 can
generally correspond to the shape of bipolar plate 800, as shown in FIG. 14.
          [0140] In certain embodiments, first seal 871 is formed from protrusions 360
as described above. For example, the protrusions can have a triangular
configuration 360a (FIG. 9A), a cusp configuration 360b (FIG. 9B), a flat blade
configuration 360c (FIG. 9C), or any other geometry sufficient to form a seal surface.
In other embodiments, at least two of first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal
891 are formed from protrusions 360, and in certain embodiments, all three of first
seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891 are formed from protrusions 360.
          [0141] First seal 871 can define a portion of high pressure zone 870 and be
configured to contain a first fluid 872 (e.g., hydrogen) within high pressure zone 870.
First seal 871 can delimit the outer boundaries of high pressure zone 870 at least
between components 801 and 802. High pressure zone 870 can include flow
structure 805 extending through void 803 when first component 801 and second
component 802 are coupled. First fluid 872 can flow throughout high pressure zone
870 thorough flow structure 805 from cathode 130.
          [0142] Hydrogen formed at cathode 130 can be collected in high pressure
zone 870 and the connection between first component 801 and second component
802 can be sealed by first seal 871. Hydrogen within high pressure zone 870 can be
compressed and, as a result, increase in pressure as more and more hydrogen is
formed in high pressure zone 870. Hydrogen in high pressure zone 870 can be

compressed to a pressure greater than 15,000 psi. Pressure within high pressure
zone 870 can apply a separation force on first component 801 and second
components 802.
            [0143] As shown in FIG. 14, first seal 871 can be configured to extend around
the exterior of common passages 804. Common passages 804 can be configured to
supply or discharge first fluid 872 from high pressure zone 870. Common passages
804 can be in fluid communication with common passages of adjacent
electrochemical cells in a multi-cell electrochemical compressor.
            [0144] Second seal 881 can define the outer circumference of intermediate
pressure zone 880. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can comprise an intermediate
pressure volume 883 delimited by first seal 871, second seal 881, first component
801 and second component 802. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can be configured
to contain a second fluid 882. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can further comprise
one or more intermediate pressure ports 884.
            [0145] Intermediate pressure volume 883 can be configured to collect and
direct second fluid 882 to intermediate pressure ports 884. As shown in FIG. 14,
intermediate pressure volume 883 can extend around the circumference of high
pressure zone 870 separated by first seal 871. The cross-sectional area and volume
of intermediate pressure volume 883 can vary based on the geometry of first
component 801, second component 802, first seal 871, and second seal 881.
            [0146] In other embodiments, intermediate pressure volume 883 can be
separated into a plurality of intermediate pressure volumes 883, for example, 2, 3, 4
or more intermediate pressure volumes 883. The plurality of intermediate pressure
volumes 883 can be separated by a plurality of seals. As shown in FIG. 14,
intermediate pressure volume 883 can be separated into two intermediate pressure
volumes 883. For example, as shown in FIG. 14, first seal 871 can extend across
intermediate pressure volume 883 to second seal 881. The portions of first seal 881
that extend around common passages 804 can connect with second seal 882
separating intermediate pressure volume 883 into two intermediate pressure
volumes 883.
            [0147] As shown in FIG. 14, the one or more intermediate pressure volumes
883 can each be in fluid communication with one or more intermediate pressure
ports 884. Intermediate pressure ports 884 can be configured to discharge second
fluid 882 contained within intermediate pressure volumes 883. The shape of

intermediate pressure ports 884 can vary. For example, intermediate pressure ports
884 can be square, rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle, oval, or other shape. The
number of intermediate pressure ports 884 per intermediate pressure volume 883
can vary from 1 to about 25 or more. The cross-sectional area of intermediate
pressure ports 884 can vary. For example, the diameter of circular intermediate
pressure ports 884 can range from less than about 0.1 inch to about 1 inch or more.
As shown in FIG. 14, intermediate pressure ports 884 can be evenly spaced
between first seal 871 and second seal 881 and evenly distributed along the length
of bipolar plate 800. Alternately, intermediate pressure ports 884 can be non-evenly
spaced between first seal 871 and second seal 881 and/or have variable spacing
along the length of bipolar plate 800. In other embodiments, intermediate pressure
ports 884 can extend the full circumference of intermediate pressure zone 880.
            [0148] Second fluid 882 discharged via intermediate pressure ports 884 can
be resupplied to electrochemical cell 100. For example, second fluid 882 can return
to intermediate pressure zone 180. In other embodiments, second fluid 882
discharged via intermediate pressure ports 884 can be collected and recycled.
Second fluid 882 in intermediate pressure zone 880 can generally be lower pressure
than first fluid 872 in high pressure zone 870.
            [0149] Third seal 891 can define low pressure zone 890 and be configured to
contain a third fluid 892 within low pressure zone 890. Low pressure zone 890 can
comprise a low pressure volume 893 delimited by second seal 881, third seal 891,
first component 801, and second component 802. Low pressure zone 890 can be
configured to contain a third fluid 892. Low pressure zone 890 can further comprise
one or more low pressure ports 894.
            [0150] Low pressure volume 893 can be configured to collect and direct third
fluid 892 to low pressure ports 894. As shown in FIG. 14, low pressure volume 893
can extend around the circumference of intermediate pressure zone 880 separated
by second seal 881. The cross-sectional area and volume of low pressure volume
893 can vary based on the geometry of first component 801, second component
802, second seal 881, and third seal 891. According to various embodiments, the
intermediate pressure volume 883 can be greater than or less than the volume of low
pressure volume 893.
            [0151] As shown in FIG. 14, the one or more low pressure volumes 893 can
each be in fluid communication with one or more low pressure ports 894. Low

pressure ports 894 can be configured to discharge third fluid 892 contained within
low pressure volumes 893. The shape of low pressure ports 894 can vary. For
example, low pressure ports 894 can be square, rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle,
oval, or other shape. The number of low pressure ports 894 per low pressure
volume 893 can vary from 1 to 50 or more. The cross-sectional area of low pressure
ports 894 can vary. For example, the diameter of circular low pressure ports 894
can range from less than 0.1 inch to 1 inch or more. As shown in FIG. 14, low
pressure ports 894 can be spaced between second seal 881 and third seal 891 and
evenly staggered along the length of bipolar plate 800. In other embodiments, low
pressure ports 894 can extend the full circumference of low pressure zone 890.
            [0152] Third fluid 892 discharged via low pressure ports 894 can be
resupplied to electrochemical cell 100. For example, third fluid 892 can return to low
pressure zone 190. In other embodiments, third fluid 892 discharged via
intermediate pressure ports 894 can be collected and recycled. Third fluid 892 in low
pressure zone 890 can generally be lower pressure than first fluid 872 in high
pressure zone 870 and second fluid 882 in intermediate pressure zone 880.
            [0153] The cascade seal configuration between first component 801 and
second component 802 as described above can be implemented in bipolar plate 150
and 160 of electrochemical cell 100, as described above. In other embodiments, the
cascade seal configuration between components 801 and 802 can be implemented
in other electrochemical cells in which a cascade seal configuration is not utilized
between the two bipolar plates. Therefore, both cascade seal configurations as
described above can be independent of one another such that either one can be
utilized individually in an electrochemical cell or they can be utilized in conjunction in
the same electrochemical cell.
            [0154] In some embodiments, first component 801 and second component
802 can include interlocking features. The interlocking features may form a mating
geometry sufficient to secure first component 801 and second component 802
together. For example, first component 801 may comprise one or more protrusions,
and second component 802 may comprise one or more indentations. However, it is
further contemplated first component 801 and second component 802 may comprise
various attachment mechanisms. Interlocking features may comprise various
shapes and sizes. For example, protrusions and indentations may be formed
                                              - 33

cylindrical, round, elliptical, rectangular, or square in shape. Additionally, protrusions
and indentations may include various polygonal shapes.
            [0155] As shown in FIG. 14, interlocking features may include various
connections configured to seal first component 801 and second component 802. For
example, interlocking features may include first seal 871, second seal 881, and third
seal 891 and the corresponding seal cavity in which they can rest. First component
801 and second component 802 can include a plurality of seal cavities configured to
receive at least a portion of first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891. Each
seal cavity can comprise an extrusion into first component 801, second component
802 or both components 801 and 802. The extrusion dimensions and geometry can
correspond to the dimensions and cross-sectional geometry of first seal 871, second
seal 881, and third seal 891.
