        METHODS OF ADMINISTERING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF NITRIC OXIDE
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]          Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to the field of methods
 5 and devices for nitric oxide delivery.
   BACKGROUND
   [0002]           Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that, when inhaled, acts to dilate blood vessels in the
   lungs and reduces pulmonary hypertension.          Because of this, nitric oxide is provided as a
   therapeutic gas in the inspiratory breathing gases for patients with pulmonary hypertension.
10 [0003]           Current methods       of nitric   oxide  delivery  generally   require   that low
   concentrations of nitric oxide be delivered to a patient as high NO delivery concentrations are
   associated with various toxicities. Therefore, as a result, nitric oxide delivery systems require
   either the use of cylinders with low NO concentration, or if high concentration cylinders are
   used, require dilution of the NO prior to administration to the patient. If cylinders with low
15 NO concentration are used, then the cylinders need to have a large volume in order to have a
   sufficient quantity of NO so that the cylinders do not need to be frequently replaced.         Such
   large cylinders reduce the portability of the nitric oxide delivery system and make it less
   suitable for home use.
   [0004]           Therefore, there is a need to provide alternative methods of nitric oxide delivery
20 that enable portable nitric oxide delivery systems that are convenient for home use.
   SUMMARY
   [0005]           One aspect of the present invention provides a method of delivering nitric
   oxide to a patient, the method comprising administering a dose of nitric oxide at a delivery
   concentration of greater than 2,000 ppm. The dose of nitric oxide may be administered at a
25 certain dosing rate, such as less than 200 micrograms of nitric oxide per second (pg NO/sec).
   In various embodiments, the dosing rate may be less than or equal to 200, 175, 166, 150, 125,
    100, 95, 90, 85, 83, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, or 50 pg NO/sec.
   [0006]          According to one or more embodiments of this aspect, the dose of nitric oxide is
   administered during inspiration.

                                                   2
   [0007]          In certain embodiments, the nitric oxide is administered as a "pulse" or "bolus."
   Other embodiments provide that the nitric oxide is administered continuously.
   [0008]          Some embodiments provide that the nitric oxide is administered every nth
   breath, wherein n is 1 or greater. According to one or more embodiments, n is 1 such that the
 5 dose is administered every breath. In other embodiments, n is greater than I such that the dose
   is intermittent. Intermittent administration may also include skipping breaths randomly or if
   the dose to be administered in a given breath is lower than a threshold amount that may be
   delivered by the nitric oxide delivery device.
   [00091          In one or more embodiments, the delivery concentration is in the range of 2,000
10 ppm to 20,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the delivery concentration is in the range of 2,200
   ppm to 5,000 ppm.
   [00101          According to one or more embodiments, the dose is in the range of 0.001 to 4.5
   mg/kg/hr.
   [0011]          In one or more embodiments, the nitric oxide is administered in undiluted form
15 such that the delivery concentration is the same as a storage concentration.
   [0012]          The nitric oxide administration may be part of a treatment of the various
   diseases described herein, such as pulmonary hypertension.          In some embodiments, the
   pulmonary hypertension is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or is associated with
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
20 [0013]          Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of administering a
   therapeutic gas comprising nitric oxide to a patient, the method comprising administering a
   dose of nitric oxide from a device that comprises a delivery system and a cylinder having a
   nitric oxide concentration greater than 2,000 ppm, wherein the nitric oxide is administered in
   undiluted form from the cylinder.
25 [0014]          In one or more embodiments of this aspect, the nitric oxide is administered
   every nth breath, wherein n is 1 or greater. In some embodiments, n is I such that the dose is
   administered every breath. In other embodiments, n is greater than 1 such that the dose is
   intermittent.
   [0015]          In certain embodiments, the delivery concentration of the dose is in the range of
30 about 2,000 ppm to about 10,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the delivery concentration is in
   the range of 2,200 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In a particular embodiment, the delivery concentration
   is in the range of 4,600 ppm to 5,000 ppm.

                                                    3
   [00161           The cylinder that supplies the nitric oxide may be a "mini-cylinder." In one or
   more embodiments, the cylinder has a volume in the range of 0.01 to 1 L. According to some
   embodiments, the cylinder volume is in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 L.
   [0017]           According to one or more embodiments of this aspect, the dose is in the range
 5 of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr.
   [0018]           Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of reducing the
   nasal irritation of a patient during nitric oxide administration.    In various embodiments, the
   nitric oxide dosing rate does not exceed a certain rate to reduce the incidence of nasal irritation.
   The dosing rate may be any of the dosing rates described herein, such as less than or equal to
10 200, 166, 100 or 83 pg NO/sec.
   [0019]           Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating
   pulmonary hypertension comprising administering a therapeutic gas comprising a dose of nitric
   oxide to a patient from a device that comprises a delivery system and a cylinder, wherein the
   dose has a delivery concentration of greater than 2,000 ppm. In one or more embodiments, the
15 nitric oxide is administered every nth breath, wherein n is 1 or greater.
   [0020]           In some embodiments of this aspect, the dose is in the range of 0.001 to 4.5
   mg/kg/hr.
   [0021]           According to one or more embodiments, the nitric oxide is administered in
   undiluted form such that the delivery concentration is the same as a storage concentration.
20 [0022]           The foregoing has outlined rather broadly certain features and technical
   advantages of the present invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the
   specific embodiments disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing
   other structures or processes within the scope present invention. It should also be realized by
   those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and
25 scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
   [0023]           So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present invention
   can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized
   above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended
30 drawing.     It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawing illustrates only typical

                                                    4
   embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for
   the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments.
   [0024]           FIG. 1 shows a nitric oxide delivery system that can be used in accordance with
   one or more embodiments of the invention.
 5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0025]           Nitric oxide (NO) is typically supplied from cylinders that contain up to about
    1000 ppm NO in a carrier gas, such as nitrogen.       Embodiments of the present invention use
   NO in a carrier gas, the NO having a concentration of 2,000 ppm or more (e.g., up to 5,000 or
   even 30,000 ppm), where a volume of gas from the source is controlled to deliver dosing of the
10 NO using either a constant concentration, pulsed or other method of NO delivery to patients
   and measured in ppm, mL/breath, mg/breath, mg/kg/hour or any other manner of dosing
   measurement. The carrier gas may be nitrogen. Embodiments of the present invention also
   include continuous NO delivery.
   [00261           In addition, it has been surprisingly found that nasal tolerability of NO was
15 independent of concentration of NO being delivered, but was dependent on dose and dosing
   rate. Prior to the current application, high concentrations of nitric oxide were considered toxic,
   especially    concentrations   above   1,000 ppm.       The  Occupational    Safety   and Health
   Administration (OSHA) has recognized the potential toxicity of nitric oxide and has
   established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 25 ppm.             However, unexpectedly this
20 invention describes a method of safely administering nitric oxide at concentrations above 2,000
   ppm.    This is particularly true if the NO dosing rate is less than or equal to about 166 pig
   NO/sec.
   [0027]           Before describing several exemplary embodiments of the invention, it is to be
   understood that the invention is not limited to the details of construction or process steps set
25 forth in the following description. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being
   practiced or being carried out in various ways.
   [00281           As used herein, "cylinder concentration" refers to the concentration of nitric
   oxide in the therapeutic gas source, which is typically a gas storage cylinder.          Cylinder
   concentrations are typically expressed in parts per million (ppm), with the remainder of the gas
30 in the cylinder comprising a carrier gas such as nitrogen.

                                                    5
   [0029]            "Delivery concentration" refers to the concentration of nitric oxide in the
   delivery tube immediately prior to the delivery point to the patient, i.e. entering the breathing
   mask, exiting the nasal cannula, etc. Delivery concentration does not necessarily refer to the
   alveolar (i.e. lung) concentration, as the delivery concentration may be diluted in the patient's
 5 trachea or lungs.    "Alveolar concentration" refers to the concentration of nitric oxide in the
   alveoli or lungs.
   [0030]           According to certain embodiments, the therapeutic gas comprising nitric oxide
   may undergo dilution in the patient delivery tube due to the presence of other gases entering
   through the patient end of the patient delivery tube.
10 [0031]           In some embodiments, a "cylinder exit concentration" is defined as the
   concentration of nitric oxide in the therapeutic gas immediately after exiting the gas storage
   cylinder and entering the patient delivery tube, but prior to any dilution in the patient delivery
   tube. In other embodiments, a "valve exit concentration" is defined as the concentration of
   nitric oxide in the therapeutic gas immediately after exiting the control valve, but prior to any
15 dilution in the patient delivery tube.
   [0032]           One aspect of the current invention relates to a method of delivering nitric oxide
   to a patient comprising administering a dose of nitric oxide having a delivery concentration of
   greater than 2,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the delivery concentration is in the range of
   2,000 ppm to 30,000 ppm. According to one or more embodiments, the delivery concentration
20 is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In other embodiments, the delivery concentration is
   greater than 2,200 ppm. Some embodiments provide that the delivery concentration is in the
   range of 2,200 ppm to 10,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the delivery concentration is in
   the range of 2,200 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In a particular embodiment, the delivery concentration
   is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 2,600 ppm. In another embodiment, the delivery concentration
25 is in the range of 4,000 ppm to 6,000 ppm. According to another embodiment, the delivery
   concentration is in the range of 4,600 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the delivery
   concentration is about 2,440 ppm or about 4,880 ppm.
   [0033]           According to one or more embodiments, the cylinder exit concentration is
   greater than 2,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the cylinder exit concentration is in the range
30 of 2,000 ppm to 30,000 ppm.         According to one or more embodiments, the cylinder exit
   concentration is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In other embodiments, the cylinder

                                                    6
   exit concentration is greater than 2,200 ppm. Some embodiments provide that the cylinder exit
   concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 10,000 ppm.           In certain embodiments, the
   cylinder exit concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 5,000 ppm.              In a particular
   embodiment, the cylinder exit concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 2,600 ppm. In
 5 another embodiment, the cylinder exit concentration is in the range of 4,000 ppm to 6,000
   ppm.     According to another embodiment, the cylinder exit concentration is in the range of
   4,600 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the cylinder exit concentration is about 2,440
   ppm or about 4,880 ppm.
   [00341           In one or more embodiments, the dose of nitric oxide has a valve exit
10 concentration of greater than 2,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the valve exit concentration
   is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 30,000 ppm. According to one or more embodiments, the valve
   exit concentration is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In other embodiments, the valve
   exit concentration is greater than 2,200 ppm. Some embodiments provide that the valve exit
   concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 10,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the valve
15 exit concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In a particular embodiment, the
   valve exit concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 2,600 ppm. In another embodiment,
   the valve exit concentration is in the range of 4,000 ppm to 6,000 ppm. According to another
   embodiment, the valve exit concentration is in the range of 4,600 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In some
   embodiments, the valve exit concentration is about 2,440 ppm or about 4,880 ppm.
20 [00351           Any of the methods described herein may limit the dosing rate of nitric oxide to
   help reduce adverse events such as nasal irritation. As will be explained in more detail in the
   Examples below, it was surprisingly found that nasal tolerability was dependent on the dosing
   rate, not the nitric oxide concentration.     Accordingly, utilizing specific dosing rates may
   increase the safety of nitric oxide administration.    In various embodiments, the nitric oxide
25 dosing rate may be less than or equal to any of the following rates: 200, 175, 166, 150, 125,
    100, 95, 90, 85, 83, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, or 50 pg NO/sec. The nitric oxide dosing rate is
   proportional to the concentration of nitric oxide in the therapeutic gas and the flow rate of the
   therapeutic gas.     For example, flowing therapeutic gas at 2 L/min with a nitric oxide
   concentration of 800 ppm will provide a dosing rate of 33 ag NO/sec. Higher nitric oxide
30 concentrations will require lower therapeutic gas flow rates to be under the threshold for nasal
   irritation. If the nitric oxide concentration delivered to the patient is greater than 2,000 ppm,
   then the therapeutic gas flow rate needs to be less than I L/min to provide a dosing rate less

                                                      7
   than 166 pg NO/sec.        Accordingly, in some embodiments, the flow rate of therapeutic gas
   delivered to the patient is less than or equal to the following values: 2, 1.5, 1.25, 1, 0.9, 0.8,
   0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1 or 0.05 L/min. In a specific embodiment,
   the delivery concentration is about 4,880 ppm and the dosing rate is less than or equal to about
 5 0.4 L/min. In another specific embodiment, the delivery concentration is about 2,440 ppm and
   the dosing rate is less than or equal to about 0.8 L/min.
   [0036]            The amount of nitric oxide that is delivered to the patient will depend on many
   factors. For example, patients that are receiving nitric oxide treatment for various conditions
   may be prescribed different doses of nitric oxide. Doses that have been reported for use in
10 treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTE), idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis (IPF) or pulmonary hypertension (PH), or using nitric oxide as an antimicrobial agent,
   may be in the range of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the dose of
   nitric oxide is in the range of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr. In other embodiments, the dose of nitric
15 oxide is in the range of 0.001 to 0.5 mg/kg/hr.
   [0037]           Also, the dose of nitric oxide may depend on the ideal body weight of the
   patient. The ideal body weight is related to the lung size of the patient, and will typically be
   based on the patient's height and gender. As a result, patients with differing lung sizes may be
   administered different amounts of nitric oxide (in mg/kg/hr or mg/kg/breath).
20 [0038]           According to one or more embodiments, the nitric oxide is only delivered
   during a portion of the patient's breathing cycle.        In such embodiments, the nitric oxide is
   delivered as a pulse instead of a continuous flow of nitric oxide-containing gas. A "pulse,"
   also known as a "bolus" or "plug" or "spike," refers to a single abrupt pulsation or emission of
   gas. This pulse may be administered during various parts of the patient's breathing cycle. In
25 certain embodiments, the pulse is administered during the first half of inspiration.
   [00391           In other embodiments, the nitric oxide is delivered continuously to the patient.
   [0040]           FIG. 1 shows an exemplary nitric oxide delivery system 100 for carrying out
   certain embodiments of the nitric oxide administration method.           Gas storage cylinder 103
   contains a therapeutic gas comprising nitric oxide, with a cylinder concentration greater than
30 2,000 ppm. Gas storage cylinder 103 is in fluid communication with patient delivery tube 113,
   which carries the therapeutic gas from gas storage cylinder 103 to patient breathing mask 111.

                                                   8
   Control valve 105 regulates the flow of therapeutic gas through patient delivery tube 113.
   Central processing unit (CPU) 107 is in communication with control valve 105, and CPU 107
   sends and receives signals from the control valve 105 to open and close the control valve 105.
   To deliver a pulse of therapeutic gas, CPU 107 opens control valve 105 to allow therapeutic
 5 gas to flow through patient delivery tube 113 to patient breathing mask 111. Control valve 105
   is only open for a certain period of time, and the length of the time period will determine the
   volume of the pulse of therapeutic gas.      For example, when control valve 105 is open for a
   longer period of time, the amount of therapeutic gas in the pulse increases.            In certain
   embodiments, the pulse size may vary from one pulse to the next so that the total amount of
10 therapeutic gas administered over a given time interval is constant, even though a patient's
   breathing rate may change during this interval.
   [0041]          The pulse of gas comprising nitric oxide may be administered every breath, or it
   may be administered intermittently. Thus, according to one or more embodiments, the nitric
   oxide is administered every nth breath, wherein n is 1 or greater. In some embodiments, n is 1,
15 so the pulse is administered to the patient every breath. According to other embodiments, n is
   greater than 1, thus providing intermittent administration of the dose. For example, when n is
   2, the dose is administered every other breath. When the administration is intermittent, n does
   not need to be a whole number, thus allowing for many possible dosing schedules.               For
   example, when n is 1.5, the dose will be administered 2 out of every 3 breaths.
20 [0042]          The CPU 107 may be in communication with a user input device 115. This user
   input device 115 can receive desired settings from the user, such as the patient's prescription in
   mg/kg/hr or mg/kg/breath, patient's age, height, sex, weight, etc.
   [0043]          The CPU 107 may also be in communication with a flow sensor (not shown),
   which would measure the flow of therapeutic gas through control valve 105. The CPU 107 can
25 be coupled to a memory 117 and may be one or more of readily available memory such as
   random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), flash memory, compact disc,
   floppy disk, hard disk, or any other form of local or remote digital storage. Support circuits
   (not shown) can be coupled to the CPU 107 to support the CPU 107 in a conventional manner.
   These circuits include cache, power supplies, clock circuits, input/output circuitry, subsystems,
30 and the like.

                                                    9
   [0044]          The memory 117 may store a set of machine-executable instructions for
   calculating the desired volume of the gas pulse and the pulsing schedule to achieve a particular
   patient prescription. For example, if the patient's breathing rate and the cylinder concentration
   are known, then the CPU 107 can calculate how much volume of therapeutic gas needs to be
 5 administered each breath or set of breaths to provide the desired dosage of nitric oxide. The
   memory 117 may also record the time that the control valve 105 is open during each pulse, so
   that future calculations can take into account how much nitric oxide has previously been
   administered.
   [0045]          When the gas pulse is delivered only during a portion of the patient's breathing
10 cycle, the system further comprises a patient trigger sensor (not shown). The patient trigger
   sensor can be any suitable pressure sensor. When the patient breathes in during inspiration, it
   creates a small subatmospheric pressure in the patient delivery tube 113. The patient trigger
   sensor detects this pressure drop and provides a signal to the CPU 107 that the patient is
   beginning inspiration. The CPU 107 can then send a signal to the control valve 105 so that the
15 control valve 105 may be opened to deliver the pulse of therapeutic gas.
   [0046]          Similarly, when the patient breathes out, there is a positive pressure in the
   patient delivery tube 113 and the patient trigger sensor can detect the positive pressure and
   provide a signal to the CPU 107 indicating the beginning of expiration. As a result, when a
   patient trigger sensor is used, it is possible for the system to determine the inspiratory and
20 expiratory times in addition to the respiratory rate of the patient.
   [00471          As the pulse of therapeutic gas contains a high concentration of nitric oxide, the
   pulse may have a relatively small volume of therapeutic gas and still have the same amount of
   nitric oxide as a higher volume pulse with a lower concentration of nitric oxide. Therefore, in
   certain embodiments, the dose of nitric oxide is a small-volume pulse.
25 [0048]          According to one or more embodiments, the pulse volume is in the range of
   0.001-20 mL. The pulse volume may be as high as 80 mL. Exemplary pulse volumes include
   about 0.05 mL, about 0.1 mL, about 0.15 mL, about 0.2 mL, about 0.25 mL, about 0.3 mL,
   about 0.35 mL, about 0.4 mL, about 0.45 mL, about 0.5 mL, about 0.55 mL, about 0.6 mL,

   [0049]          Certain embodiments provide that the nitric oxide is undiluted before
   administering to the patient. As shown in FIG. 1, the therapeutic gas can be delivered to
   patient breathing mask 111 without dilution prior to delivery. Thus, the delivery concentration
   measured at point 109 is the same as or similar or substantially similar to the cylinder
 5 concentration in gas storage cylinder 103.     Reference to the delivery concentration and the
   cylinder concentration being the same concentration means that no inert gas is used to dilute
   the storage concentration, and the delivery concentration is the same order of magnitude as the
   storage concentration.
   [0050]          Administering high nitric oxide concentrations allows for the use of smaller gas
10 storage cylinders 103 as the nitric oxide source. For example, a cylinder with about 4,880 ppm
   of nitric oxide and having a volume of about 0.16 L would generally only need to be changed
   every 24-96 hours for a 70 kg patient with a prescription of 0.029-0.114 mg/kg/hr. In contrast,
   the same patient would need to change a 0.16 L cylinder with a concentration of about 800 pm
   every 4 to 16 hours.
15 [0051]          Thus, another aspect of the current invention pertains to administering a dose of
   nitric oxide from a portable device that comprises a delivery system and a mini-cylinder. As
   used herein, a "mini-cylinder" is a gas storage cylinder that has a smaller volume and/or lighter
   weight than a typical cylinder used for delivering nitric oxide. In certain embodiments, a mini
   cylinder is a storage cylinder having a volume of less than 2L or less than 1 L. In other
20 embodiments, a mini-cylinder has a volume less than 0.5 L. According to other embodiments,
   a mini-cylinder has a volume less than 0.2 L
   [0052]          According to one or more embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the
   range of 0.01 to 1 L. In certain embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of
   0.05 to 0.5 L. In other embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of 0.1 to 0.3
25 L. In a particular embodiment, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of 0.15 to 0.2 L.
   [00531          In one or more embodiments, the concentration of nitric oxide in the mini
   cylinder is greater than 2,000 ppm. In certain embodiments, the mini-cylinder concentration is
   in the range of 2,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm. According to one or more embodiments, the mini
   cylinder concentration is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In other embodiments, the
30 mini-cylinder concentration is greater than 2,200 ppm. Some embodiments provide that the
   mini-cylinder concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 10,000 ppm. Other embodiments

                                                    11
   provide that the mini-cylinder concentration is in the range of 2,000 ppm to 5,000 ppm. In a
   particular embodiment, the mini-cylinder concentration is in the range of 2,200 ppm to 2,600
   ppm. In another embodiment, the mini-cylinder concentration is in the range of 4,000 ppm to
   6,000 ppm. In a specific embodiment, mini-cylinder concentration is in the range of 4,600
 5 ppm to 5,000 ppm.
   [00541          A portable device with a mini-cylinder may also be used to provide a pulse of
   therapeutic gas. Thus, according to one or more embodiments, a portable device administers
   nitric oxide every nth breath, wherein n is 1 or greater. In some embodiments, n is 1, so the
   pulse is administered to the patient every breath. According to other embodiments, n is greater
10 than 1, thus providing intermittent administration of the dose.
   [0055]          Another aspect of the current invention provides a method of treating
   pulmonary hypertension comprising administering a therapeutic gas comprising a dose of nitric
   oxide having a delivery concentration greater than 2,000 ppm. The therapeutic gas may be
   administered to the patient from a portable device comprising a delivery system and a mini
15 cylinder.   As with the methods of delivering nitric oxide described above, the delivery
   concentration, cylinder exit concentration, valve exit concentration, or cylinder concentration
   of the therapeutic gas used for treating pulmonary hypertension may be within any of the
   specified ranges.
   [0056]          For treating pulmonary hypertension, the nitric oxide can be administered every
20 nth breath, wherein n is I or greater. In certain embodiments, n is 1. In other embodiments, n
   is greater than 1, thus providing intermittent dosing.       Some conditions are treated more
   effectively with pulsed administration versus continuous administration of therapeutic gas. For
   example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is more effectively treated with
   pulsed administration, and continuous delivery of nitric oxide can actually worsen the
25 symptoms of COPD.
   [00571          The dose of nitric oxide for treating pulmonary hypertension can be in the range
   of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr.      As mentioned above, doses that have been reported for use in
   treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTE), idiopathic pulmonary
30 fibrosis (IPF) or pulmonary hypertension (PH), or using nitric oxide as an antimicrobial agent,
   may be in the range of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the dose of

                                                   12
   nitric oxide is in the range of 0.001 to 4.5 mg/kg/hr. In other embodiments, the dose of nitric
   oxide is in the range of 0.001 to 0.5 mg/kg/hr. In certain embodiments, the mini-cylinder used
   to treat pulmonary hypertension has a volume of less than I L. In other embodiments, the
   mini-cylinder has a volume less than 0.5 L.        According to other embodiments, the mini
 5 cylinder has a volume less than 0.2 L
   [00581          According to one or more embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the
   range of 0.01 to 1 L. In certain embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of
   0.05 to 0.5 L. In other embodiments, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of 0.1 to 0.3
   L. In a particular embodiment, the mini-cylinder has a volume in the range of 0.15 to 0.2 L.
10 [0059]          In one or more embodiments          of the   method for treating     pulmonary
   hypertension, the therapeutic gas is not diluted prior to administering to the patient. In such
   embodiments, the delivery concentration is the same as or similar to the cylinder concentration.
   EXAMPLES
   Example 1: Nasal Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Dosing
15 [0060]          A multiple-dose, single-blind, placebo-controlled, tolerance study of pulsed
   volumes of nitric oxide was completed using healthy subjects. An objective of the study was
   to determine safe dosing limits of inhaled nitric oxide delivered via a pulse system at cylinder
   concentrations of 100, 400, and 800 ppm and gas volumes ranging from 4 to 60 mL/breath at
   dose rates ranging from 17 to 166 pig of NO/sec. Yet another objective of the study was to
20 determine the safety profile, including adverse events (AEs), vital signs and laboratory
   parameters.
   Methodology:
   Six subjects were assigned to each cohort (5 NO, 1 placebo) in a randomized, single-blind
   fashion. All subjects received 72 hours of continuous inhalation. A total of 22 cohorts were
25 evaluated, with NO doses ranging from 125 to 1500 nmol/breath at delivery concentrations of
    100, 400, or 800 ppm and varying volumes (4 to 60 mL per breath) in a matrix design, as
   shown in Table 1. Vital signs and safety laboratory were evaluated.          Blood samples for
   determination of methemoglobin (MetHb) in venous blood, were collected for 72 hours at
   selected time points.

   Number of Subjects:
   [0061]          A total of 132 subjects were enrolled, 131 received treatment (110 NO, 21
   placebo) and 129 completed the 72-hour treatment period.
 5 Safety:
   [0062]          Primary safety evaluations included: (1) qualitative assessment of local nasal
   tolerability via a scoring system (0 to 3); and (2) formation of MetHb (compared with a
   standard of 7%) following varying concentrations and volumes of pulsed doses of NO. Safety
   evaluations included     assessments of adverse events (AEs), medical history, physical
10 examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory assessments at baseline
   and during the study period.
   Statistical Methods:
   [0063]          All evaluations were performed on the 'Safety'       population, defined as all
   subjects who were enrolled and treated with any amount of study drug. Descriptive statistics
15 included mean, standard deviation (SD), range, median, CV%, geometric mean and geometric
   CV%.
   [0064]          For analysis purposes, cohorts that received the same dose of NO but different
   cylinder concentrations and volumes were pooled, thereby creating 15 dose levels (n         =  14
   active NO and I placebo, from all dose groups combined). These 15 dose levels were grouped
20 into 4 dose analysis groups: placebo, low-dose NO (1-500 nmol/breath), mid-dose NO (501
    1000 nmol/breath), and high-dose NO (1001-1500 nmol/breath).
   [0065]          For analysis purposes, cohorts that received the same dose rate of administration
   of NO but different cylinder concentrations, doses and volumes were pooled, thereby creating
   6 dose rate of administration levels (n = 5 active NO and 1 placebo, from all rate of
25 administration groups combined). The dose rate of administration of NO was calculated as the
   product of the flow rate of NO and the cylinder NO concentration.
   Adverse Events:
   [0066]          The overall incidence of AEs was only dose related. Table 2 below shows that
   the most frequently occurring AEs, including headache, back pain, and nausea.

   One subject (6.7%) in the high-dose NO group withdrew due to chest discomfort, decreased 02
 5 saturation, and dyspnea.
   Nasal Tolerability:
   [0067]           Analysis for nasal tolerability at 72 hours by individual NO dose group, pulse
   volume of carrier airflow, and NO cylinder concentration demonstrates that the nasal
   tolerability was related to the dose levels and NO flow rate used in the trial as there was no
10 correlation with either pulse volume or cylinder concentration. A multivariate analysis, with
   tolerability score as the response variable and with dose level, cylinder concentration and pulse
   volume as the covariates, demonstrated that the NO dose level was the only significant
   covariate (p =0.006). The cylinder concentration (p =0.525) and the pulse volume (p = 0.077)
   were not significant; however the tolerability was affected by NO dosing rate.              Nasal
15 tolerability at dosing rates up to 166 pg/sec were not different from placebo; a dosing rate of
    166 pg g/sec was associated with a higher incidence of nasal irritation, including a case of
   nasal ulceration. Therefore, the nasal tolerability after 72 hours of pulsed dosing of NO is
   related to the NO dose and the dosing rate and not to either the pulsed volume of carrier
   airflow or the NO cylinder concentration.        Tables 3, 4 5 and 6 show the local tolerability
20 analysis based on dose level, cylinder concentration, pulse volume and dosing rate,
   respectively.
   [0068]           Furthermore, at clinical doses less than 420 nmol/breath (about 0.4 mg/kg/hr in
   an average 70 kg adult with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min), there was no evidence of
   nasal irritation with 48 hours of continuous administration of NO and at 72 hours the nasal
25 tolerability is no different than for placebo (3/18 placebo subjects with nasal redness vs. 2/18
   NO subjects with nasal redness).

   Example 2: Administration of High Doses of Nitric Oxide
   [0069]           In this prophetic example, patients are administered a dose of nitric oxide
   during inspiration, the dose comprising a delivery concentration of greater than 2,000 ppm.
   Some patients are administered a dose of nitric oxide in the range of 2,200 to 2,600 ppm, such
 5 as about 2,440 ppm nitric oxide. Other patients are administered a dose of nitric oxide in the
   range of 4,400 to 5,000 ppm nitric oxide, such as about 4,880 ppm nitric oxide. Other patients
   may be administered doses above 5,000 ppm, including up to about 20,000 ppm nitric oxide.
   [0070]           The patients are administered a pulse of therapeutic gas comprising nitric oxide
   every nth breath, with n being greater than or equal to 1. For one group of patients, n is equal
10 to one such that the pulse of therapeutic gas is administered every breath. For another group of
   patients, n is greater than 1 such that the pulse of therapeutic gas is administered intermittently.
