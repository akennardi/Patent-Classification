A ROTOR FOR AN ELECTRICITY GENERATOR
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a rotor for an electricity generator.
[0002] The invention has been primarily developed for use in a rotor for a hydro-powered
electricity generator. Such generators are used to convert kinetic energy from flowing fluids,
such as water and wind, to electrical power.
Background of the Invention
[0003] Kinetic energy in flowing fluids, such as water and wind, is a known alternative to
energy sources such as bio-fuels and fossil fuels for generating power. Unlike, for example,
bio- and fossil fuels which, when used in electrical power generation, go hand-in-hand with
emission of harmful combustion gasses into the atmosphere, generation of power by using
flowing fluids has no or very little adverse effects on the atmosphere.
[0004] Known installations for harvesting wind power generally have low running costs,
however they tend to be expensive to install and have relatively low generation capacity.
Known installations for harvesting hydropower, for example tidal power, on the other hand,
have relatively higher generation capacity.
[0005] Known hydro-powered electricity generators typically have a rotor comprising a central
hub to which is attached two or more outwardly extending blades. The rotor is connected by a
drive shaft to a rotary work to electrical power converter (i.e. a generator). Fluid flowing past
the rotor blades causes it to rotate which in turn causes the rotation in the converter and the
generation of electrical power.
[0006] Known rotors have a relatively small diameter hub and relatively long and slender
blades. The blades also have a relatively high aspect ratio (being the ratio of the blade
length to the blade width). Such blades are prone to high operating loads and subject to
extreme bending moments in turbulent fluid flow. This typically results in broken blades.
Summary of the Invention

                                                   2
[0007] In a first aspect, the present invention provides a rotor for a hydro-powered electricity
generator, the rotor including:
        a hub with a circular cross sectional shape and a longitudinal rotational axis,
        a plurality of blades, each having a proximal root and a distal tip, each of the blade
roots being mounted to the hub at the widest part thereof,
        wherein the ratio between the diameter of the tips of the blades to the diameter of
the widest part of the hub is less than about 2:1.
[0008] Preferably, the ratio between the diameter of the tips of the blades to the diameter of
the widest part of the hub is between about 1.2:1 and 2:1.
[0009] Preferably, the ratio between the diameter of the tips of the blades to the diameter of
the widest part of the hub is about 1.5:1 or 1.6:1.
[0010] In one embodiment, the diameter of the tips of the blades is between 3.6 and 4.8
metres and the diameter of the widest part of the hub is 2.4 metres.
[0011] In another embodiment, the diameter of the tips of the blades is between 30 and 32
metres and the diameter of the widest part of the hub is 20 metres.
[0012] The profile radius of the hub surface, in the region where each of the blade roots are
mounted to the hub, is preferably between 1/6th of and equal to the radius of the widest part
of the hub.
[0013] In a second aspect, the present invention provides a rotor for a hydro-powered
electricity generator suitable for installation in a free stream, the rotor including:
          a hub formed of a shape with a circular cross section and a longitudinal rotational
axis, the hub shape adapted to cause pressure in fluid flowing local to the hub to decrease
relative to pressure of a balance of fluid in the free stream, and
          a plurality of blades, each having a proximal root and a distal tip, each of the blade
roots being mounted to the hub at the widest part thereof,
          wherein the mounted position of the blade roots is configured so that energy in the
free stream of the fluid is concentrated in a region of the blades.

                                                   3
[0014] In some embodiments, the relative pressure decrease in the fluid flowing local to the
hub results from an increase in velocity of that fluid relative to velocity of the balance of fluid
in the free stream.
[0015] In some preferred embodiments, the relative pressure decrease in the fluid flowing
local to the hub leads to the concentration of the energy in the free stream being in a region
of the blades.
[0016] Preferably, the hub shape is further adapted to accelerate fluid flow reducing
turbulence in the region of the blades.
[0017] In some embodiments, the rotor is suitable for installation in fluid flows with high
levels of turbulence.
[0018] In some alternative embodiments, the rotor has an improved survivability from blade
failure relative to a rotor with a different configuration.
[0019] In some preferred and alternative embodiments, the hub shape in combination with
the configuration of the mounted position of the blade roots is adapted to enable the blades
to operate at maximum capacity whilst experiencing a lower stress loading in the blades
compared to mounting longer blades to a hub of smaller diameter.
[0020] Preferably, each blade has a span and the mounted position of each blade is adapted
such that an incident velocity and an incident angle of fluid flowing local to the hub is
approximately uniform across the blade span.
[0021] In some embodiments, the mounted position of each blade is further adapted such
that each blade can be articulated in pitch without reduction in performance induced by blade
twist.
[0022] In some alternative embodiments, allowing articulation of pitch during operation
permits the rotor to run at a constant revolution per minute rate irrespective of stream flow
velocity.
[0023] In some preferred and alternative embodiments, the rotor is connected directly to an
electrical grid.

                                                 4
[0024] In other preferred and alternative embodiments, the rotor excludes an electrical
frequency inverter drive system.
[0025] In some further preferred and alternative embodiments, the rotor excludes a shroud.
[0026] In yet still further preferred and alternative embodiments, the rotor comprises ten
blades.
[0027] Preferably, a ratio between the diameter of the tips of the blades to the diameter of
the widest part of the hub is less than about 2:1.
[0028] In some embodiments, the hub shape is adapted to redirect and concentrate fluid flow
in an inner two-thirds of the region of the blades.
[0029] In some preferred embodiments, the hub shape is further adapted to accelerate the
concentrated fluid flow to an outer one-third of the region of the blades.
[0030] Preferably, a maximum amount of energy is extracted from the outer one-third of the
region of the blades.
[0031] In some preferred and alternative embodiments, the ratio between the diameter of
the tips of the blades to the diameter of the widest part of the hub is between about 1.2:1 and
2:1.

and 4.8 metres and the diameter of the widest part of the hub is 2.4 metres.
[0034] In some preferred embodiments, the diameter of the tips of the blades is between 30
and 32 metres and the diameter of the widest part of the hub is 20 metres.
[0035] In some preferred and alternative embodiments, a surface of the hub has a profile and

Brief Description of the Drawings
[0036] Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of examples
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
[0037] Fig. 1 is a front view of a first embodiment of a rotor.
[0038] Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the rotor shown in Fig. 1 with stream lines; and
[0039] Fig. 3 is cross sectional side view of a hydro-powered electricity generator with a
second embodiment of a rotor.
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0040] Figs. 1 and 2 show a rotor 10 for a hydro-powered electricity generator suitable for
installation in a tidal flow environment. The rotor 10 includes a hub 12 with a circular cross
sectional shape and a longitudinal rotational axis 14. The rotor 10 also includes 7 equiangularly
spaced apart blades 16. The hub 10 is formed from glass reinforced plastic (GRP) or metal
skins and the blades 16 are formed from carbon fibre metal composites.
[0041] Each of the blades 16 has a proximal root 16a and distal tip 16b. Each of the blades 16
are mounted to the hub 14, at their roots 16a, at the widest part of the hub 14. The diameter
of the widest part of the hub 14 is shown as diameter D1. The diameter of the tips 16b of the
blades 16 is shown as diameter D2. In the embodiment shown, the ratio between diameters
D2:D1 is about 1.4:1.
[0042] Fig. 2 shows the rotor 10 relative to fluid flow stream lines 18 which demonstrate that
as the fluid flows around the hub 12 its velocity increases. As the fluid accelerates and the
local velocity increases, the local pressure decreases. This pressure reduction causes the fluid
to remain concentrated around the hub 12. As a result, the energy in a free stream of the fluid
is concentrated in the region of the blades 16.
[0043] Another way of describing the above D2:D1 ratio is that the diameter of the hub 12 is
relatively large compared to the length of the blades 16. The relatively large hub diameter D1
advantageously serves the dual function of: 1) concentrating the energy in the passing water

                                                  6
stream; and 2) supporting a relatively greater number of smaller and stronger blades 16,
which each have a lower aspect ratio.
[0044] In relation to the latter issue, the bending moment at the root is a function of the
aspect ratio of the blade. For example, a blade with an aspect ratio of 8:1 will have a stress
value in the root that is 16 times higher than the same blade with an aspect ratio of 4:1. In a
known 3-blade rotor with a relatively small diameter hub, the blades can only have a limited
chord length at the root due to the diameter restriction of the hub. This restriction of chord
length means that the blade root thickness must be increased, to provide sufficient strength,
over that otherwise required for an ideal foil section.
[0045] A relatively longer blade mounted to a relatively smaller hub also results in a lower
apparent velocity for a given RPM and a lower torque radius.
[0046] A thicker root, especially in the lower 1/ 3rd of the blade, combined with the lower
apparent velocity and the lower torque radius, results in a lowered contribution to the total
power of such a (known) 3-blade rotor. This isdue to the fact that the outer 1/ 3rd of the blade
in the smaller hub/larger 3-blade configuration does 63% of the work. This is a combination of
the swept area of the outer 30% of the blade, which constitutes 56% of the total surface area,
and the inner 30% of the blade producing negligible power.
[0047] In contrast, the configuration of the rotor 10 (i.e. relatively larger hub 14, relatively
shorter blades 16, relatively large number of blades 16) redirects and concentrates the fluid
flow in the inner 2/3 region and accelerates it through the outer    1 / 3 rd region where 100% of
the power can be extracted. This advantageously means that the blades 16 are operating at
maximum capacity, while also experiencing a lower stress loading.
[0048] Put another way, the D2:D1 ratio of the rotor 10 places the blades 16 in a zone of
acceleration around the hub 12 with an ideal blade length for the blades 16 to operate in that
zone. If the blades are too long relative to the hub diameter then the blades tips instead
operate in a region with no fluid acceleration and therefore do not contribute positive torque.
[0049] Fig. 3 shows a hydro-powered electricity generator 30 with a second embodiment of
rotor 32. The rotor 32 has a hub 34 and ten blades 36. Fig. 3 also shows blade root mounting

                                                  7
beams 38, a blade mounting hub 40, a fixed main spindle 42, a drive shaft 44, a gear box 46, a
support beam 48, a water seal 50, bearings 52 and a rotary electrical generator 54. The beam
48 is used to connect the generator 30 to a floating deployment rig (not shown).
[0050] Also shown on Fig. 3 is radius R, being the profile radius hub 34 in the region where the
hub 34 and the blades 36 are connected. In the preferred configuration shown, the radius R is
1/6 the radius of the hub 34. This particular ratio maximises flow acceleration while avoiding
turbulence.
[0051] One preferred form of the generator 30 has the following specifications:
          Hub diameter D1: 2.4 meters
          Blade tip diameter D2: 4.8 to 3.6 meters
          Power generation range: 50 to 300 kWs
          Flow velocity range: 1.2 to 4.2 m/sec
          Blade tip diameter to hub diameter ratio: 2:1 to 1.5:1
[0052] Another preferred form of the generator 30 has the following specifications:
          Hub diameter D1: 20 meters
          Blade tip diameter D2: 32 to 30 meters
          Power generation range: 0.5 to 5 MWs
          Flow velocity range: 1.2 to 4.0 m/sec
          Blade tip diameter to hub diameter ratio: 1.6:1 to 1.5:1
[0053] There are several advantages for hydro-powered generators due to the (relatively
larger) diameter hub to (relatively smaller) diameter blade ratios described above.
[0054] Firstly, the energy in the fluid stream is concentrated and accelerated across a set of
small blades, which improves the efficiency of the rotor.
[0055] Secondly, the total volume of the multiple (e.g. 7) smaller blades is less than the
volume of a small number of (e.g. 3) large blades, which lowers manufacturing cost.
[0056] Thirdly, the smaller blades have a lower aspect ratio, which equates to a lower bending
moment in the blade root, and a lower probability of blade breakage.

                                                  8
[0057] Fourthly, the incident velocity and the incident angle of the flow onto the smaller
blades is closer to a uniform value across the span of the blades. This equates to near zero
twist in the blade across its span, and allows the blades to be articulated in pitch control
without any performance losses induced by blade twist. Further, the ability to adjust the pitch
during operation means the rotor can be run at a constant rpm independent of the flow
stream velocity. This allows the generator to be run at a constant rpm connected directly to
the electrical grid thereby negating the cost of an electrical frequency inverter drive system.
[0058] Fifthly, rotors operating in fast flowing tidal flows are subject to high levels of
turbulence in the stream. The action of the flow acceleration of the water around the larger
hub reduces the level of turbulence into the blade region. This improves the survivability of
the blades in highly turbulence environments.
[0059] Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments,
it will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in other
forms.
