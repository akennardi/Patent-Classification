                                        ABSTRACT
        A scent delivery system includes scent delivery units that are configured to
deliver scent at a variable scent level by being turned on and off successively according
to a variable duty cycle. The scent delivery units are associated with corresponding
base scent settings. The scent delivery system also includes a central controller
configured to control the scent delivery units by generating command data based on a
scenting schedule that indicates a desired activation time for more than one implicated
scent delivery unit. The scenting schedule is configured to further indicate a scent level
bias to be applied to the base scent settings that are associated with different of the
implicated scent delivery units. The central controller is configured to generate the
command data, based upon a variation in the scent level bias, that takes into account a
corresponding variation to duty cycles that are associated with different of the implicated
scent delivery units and to communicate the command data to the different implicated
scent delivery units.

contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0002]    This document describes a scent delivery system that enables scent levels
 of one or more scent delivery machines to be varied.
                                         BACKGROUND
 [0003]    Products can be developed to deliver scents or aromas in commercial or
 office environments, such as in a hotel or a retail setting. The scents can improve a
 customer's perception of the environment and can help influence customer behavior.
 Scents and systems can be customized to reflect and complement various activities,
 events, brands, moods, or environments.
                                            SUMMARY
 [0004]    In one general aspect, a scent delivery system includes scent delivery units that
 are configured to deliver scent at a variable scent level by being turned on and off
 successively according to a variable duty cycle. The scent delivery units are associated
 with corresponding base scent settings. The scent delivery system also includes a
 central controller configured to control the scent delivery units by generating command
 data based on a scenting schedule that indicates a desired activation time for more than
 one implicated scent delivery unit. The scenting schedule is configured to further
 indicate a scent level bias to be applied to the base scent settings that are associated
                                                1

    WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
with different of the implicated scent delivery units. The central controller is configured
to generate the command data, based upon a variation in the scent level bias, that
takes into account a corresponding variation to duty cycles that are associated with
different of the implicated scent delivery units and to communicate the command data to
the different implicated scent delivery units.
[0005]     Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For
example the central controller may be configured to vary the duty cycles that are
associated with different of the implicated scent delivery units based on the scent level
bias by varying the duty cycles according to an arithmetic function. The central
controller may be configured to vary the duty cycles that are associated with different of
the implicated scent delivery units based on the scent level bias by varying the duty
cycles according to an geometric function. The central controller may be configured to
vary the duty cycles that are associated with different of the implicated scent delivery
units based on the scent level bias and scent types that are associated with different of
the implicated scent delivery units. The central controller may be configured to vary
cycle times that are associated with different of the implicated scent delivery units based
on the scent level bias. The scent delivery units may be configured to turn on and off
successively according to a variable duty cycle that ranges between 5% and 95%. The
central controller may be configured to vary the base scent settings that are associated
with different of the implicated scent delivery units based on scent types that are
associated with different of the implicated scent delivery units. The scent delivery units
may be configured to deliver scent at a variable scent level by varying one or more of
fan speed, nozzle pressure, and compressor power of each scent delivery unit. Based
upon a variation in the scent level bias, the central controller may send command data
that takes into account a corresponding variation to a corresponding one or more of fan
speed, nozzle pressure, and compressor power of the implicated scent delivery units.
The central controller may generate and send a signal to multiple scent delivery units,
where the signal reflects a duty cycle that reflects power characteristics to be applied in
successively turning the scent delivery units on and off. The central controller may
generate and send a signal to multiple scent delivery units, where the signal is a pulse
that corresponds to the multiple scent delivery units being turned on or off. The central

controller may generate and send a different signal to each of at least two scent delivery
units, where each different signal reflects a duty cycle that reflects power characteristics
to be applied in successively turning a corresponding scent delivery unit on and off.
The central controller may generate and send signals to each of at least two scent
delivery units, where the signals sent to a first of the at least two scent delivery units
vary in time relative to the signals sent to a second of the at least two scent delivery
units. The signals may include pulses that correspond to the corresponding scent
delivery unit being turned on or off.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]     A scent delivery system can include one or more scent delivery units that are
configured to release a fragrance or a scent in a controlled manner. By distributing the
one or more scent delivery units, or machines, throughout a scenting environment, a
desired scent profile can be generated in the environment. In some scenting
environments, such as a hotel, the desired scent profile can vary according to location
within the space, time of day, day of the week, etc. By incorporating a network
controlled scent delivery system, a user can control the one or more scent delivery
units, either individually or as a group, through a central controller. As further detailed
below, one or more scent intensities associated with a single unit or a group of units
may be scheduled and adjusted through the central controller. In some cases, a single
adjustment may be made to effect a change in a bias setting applicable to scent
intensities of multiple scent delivery units.
[0023]     Referring to FIG. 1, a scent delivery system 100 includes a central controller
102 that is connected to one or more scent delivery units 104 across a network 106.
The central controller 102 is configured to control the activation and deactivation of each
scent delivery unit 104 based on a user-defined schedule. The central controller 102
can also include, or have access to, a database that contains information about each
scent delivery unit 104. Such information may include, for example, the location and the
scent type of each scent delivery unit 104.
[0024]     The network 106 is configured to enable direct or indirect communications
between the central controller 102, the scent delivery units 104, and a user device 108.
Examples of the network 106 include the Internet, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Local
Area Networks (LANs), analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g.,
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), Integrated Services Digital Network
                                               4

    WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
(ISDN), and Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL)), radio, television, cable, satellite, and/or any
other delivery or tunneling mechanism for carrying data. In some implementations, the
network 106 includes wired or wireless network systems including, but not limited to,
wired Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee. In some implementations, the network 106 may be
made up of direct connections, either wired or wireless, between the scent delivery units
 104 and the central controller 102.
[0025]    Each scent delivery unit 104 is configured to deliver one or more scents and
includes a mechanism for releasing the one or more scents into the air. Each scent
delivery unit 104 can also include a network module for communicating with the central
controller 102 through the network 106. In some implementations, one or more scent
delivery units 104 can be associated with a separate network module to establish
communication with the central controller 102. This way, for example, pre-existing
scenting machines without networking capabilities may be deployed in the system 100
and controlled via the central controller 102. In some implementations, the scent
delivery units 104 can directly communicate with each other, for example via a mesh
network, so that establishing communication between each scent delivery unit 104 and
the central controller 102 may not be required.
[0026]    In one implementation, each scent delivery unit 104 includes a scent reservoir
and an atomizing device in fluid communication with the scent reservoir. In one
example, the scent reservoir is a cartridge bottle containing scented liquid, for example
a fragrant oil mixture, that emits a desired scent for the particular scent delivery unit
 104. The atomizing device can be, for example, a venturi-type atomizer that uses a
high velocity airstream, generated by an'integrated or a separate compressor, to draw
in and atomize the liquid in the cartridge bottle into small particles (e.g., under 10
microns in diameter) that can be dispersed into the air to generate the desired scent.
Movement of atomized scent particles within a scenting environment can further be
aided by airflow generated by a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
system.
[0027]    A level of scent (also referred to as an intensity of scent) associated with each
scent delivery unit 104 may need to be adjusted depending on the particular application
and may be done so in one of several ways. For example, the pressure and/or velocity
                                              5

    WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
of the atomizing air stream can be increased to atomize and disperse more scent
particles into the air, thus resulting in an increased scent level. Alternatively, or
additionally, precise control of scent levels may be achieved by operating the scent
delivery unit 104 under a duty cycle. That is, by turning the scent delivery unit 104 on
and off successively in accordance with power characteristics indicated by the duty
cycle during the time of activation, the total amount of scent particles released into the
environment, and therefore the scent level, can be precisely controlled. A cycle time of
each scenting unit 104, i.e. the period of time during which one on-off cycle occurs, may
also be varied to achieve a desired result. For example, given the same duty cycle, a
scenting unit 104 operating under a long cycle time will result in a longer off time
between each cycle, thereby increasing the period during which a customer may regain
his/her olfactory sensitivity and helping to reduce odor fatigue that may result from
prolonged exposure to scent.
[0028]     As used herein, "scent level" may refer to a total number of scent particles
released in an environment during a given amount of time. Under this definition, a
scenting scheme, for example, that constantly releases N number of particles into the
environment per second during activation time T may be said to produce the same
scent level as an alternative scenting scheme in which 2xN number of particles per
second are released during time T under a duty cycle of 50% - since in both cases, the
same total number of scent particles would be released during time T. Under the latter
scenting scheme, if the particles are released at a constant rate during the ON portion
of the duty cycle, then increasing or decreasing the duty cycle would result in a
corresponding change to the scent level.
[0029]     Notably, a strength of the scent as perceived by the user may be related but
not directly linked to the scent level. For example, even if the same machine operates
under different scent levels during multiple periods of activation, the strength of the
scent as perceived by the user across such periods may not change. This is because a
multitude of other factors, such as temperature, humidity, type of scent, number of
people in the room, HVAC settings, etc., not to mention an individual's scent perception
abilities, may affect how strong a particular scent is perceived by the user within the
particular scenting environment.

    WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
[0030]     In some implementations, each scent delivery unit 104 may be associated with
a base scent setting. The base scent setting may refer to machine-specific parameter
settings that enable the machine to create a desired scent effect at a particular location
(e.g., a room of a building). Determining the parameter settings to create a desired
scent effect requires consideration of, for example, the machine's environment at the
scent location (e.g., how close is the machine to a window, a vent, or a door), the scent
type, etc. The base scent setting may, for example, refer to an optimal cycle time (e.g.,
120 seconds) and/or duty cycle (e.g., 50%) for the particular machine that achieves the
desired scent effect at the scent location. In some cases, the base scent setting may
additionally or alternatively refer to other variable parameters of the machine, such as
fan speed, nozzle pressure, compressor power, etc., that ultimately have an impact on
the scent level.
[0031]     In some implementations, the base scent setting is determined at the time of
installation of the machine at the scent location. In other implementations, the base
scent setting may be determined prior to or subsequent to installation. The determined
base scent setting may be set by a user at the machine through user interactions with
the machine itself (in implementations in which scent setting controls are included in the
machine) and/or may be set by a user through interactions with a user device 108. The
base scent setting may be set at the time of installation as part of the installation
process and/or may be set subsequent to installation of the machine as part of a later
machine initialization process. After being set, the base scent setting may be
subsequently changed by a user at the machine through interactions with the machine
itself and/or by a user (local or remote to the machine) through interactions with the user
device 108. In some cases, the central controller and/or the machine may require
additional user credentials for changing the base scent setting. For example, only a
user with systems administrator privileges may be able to change the base scent
setting.
[0032]     The central controller 102, which can be, for example, a rack mountable
server, is configured to maintain a database that includes information about each scent
delivery unit 104 in the system 100. This information can include, for example, the
physical as well as network location of each scent delivery unit 104 along with
                                                7

    WO 2015/006463                                                        PCT/US2014/045977
information about the type of scent it contains. The database can also include, for
example, information about a base scent setting of each scenting unit 104, as specified
by, for example, its cycle time and duty cycle. In some implementations, information
about the base scent setting of each scent unit 104, or any other machine-specific
parameter, may be directly stored in or otherwise accessed by each scent unit 104.
Under this implementation, each scent unit 104 may send or otherwise make accessible
the machine-specific parameters to the central controller 102 upon request.
[0033]     The central controller 102 may also be configured to maintain a master
schedule that can be accessed by the user and that incorporates multiple scheduled
events for each scent delivery unit 104. Each scheduled event specifies control logic to
activate and deactivate the one or more scent delivery units 104 during desired one or
more time periods. The control logic may activate and deactivate the one or more scent
delivery units 104 individually and/or in user-defined groups. In one implementation, the
master schedule may refer to an aggregate of all scheduled events for all scent delivery
units within the network controlled system 100. The master schedule may be stored in
or otherwise accessible through the central controller 102. In some cases, the master
schedule may refer to a group of particular scheduled events, for example, all
scheduled events pertaining to scent delivery units positioned in a certain location (e.g.,
a particular building, a particular floor of a building, or a particular room or set of rooms
in a building). In some cases, the master schedule may include a collection of other
master schedules.
[0034]     To program a desired scenting schedule for the one or more scent delivery
units 104, a user can access the central controller 102 through use of the user device
108. The user device 108 may be, for example a personal computer or a mobile device.
In some implementations, the user device 108 is configured to communicate with the
central controller 102 through the network 106. In some implementations, the user
device 108 may additionally or alternatively access the central controller 102 by directly
connecting to it without going through a network. Notably, while only one user device
108 is shown in FIG. 1, it should be understood that the system 100 can include multiple
user devices 108, each of which enables a different user to communicate with the
central controller 102 to, for example, schedule one or more scenting events. The one
                                                8

    WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
or more scenting events are compiled by the central controller 102 into a master
schedule, which, in some implementations, may be presented in whole or in part to the
 user of the user device 108 to facilitate event scheduling.
 [0035]    The central controller 102 can include a user interface component that allows
the user to make changes to the master schedule and to access and update the
database that includes information about each scent delivery unit 104. In some
 implementations, the user interface component is a user interface web component that
allows the user to make changes to the master schedule and to access and update the
scent delivery unit database over the World Wide Web.
[0036]     Based on the master schedule and the machine-specific information available
from the database, the central controller 102 can generate a set of machine-specific
command data that corresponds to the desired schedule. In one implementation, the
central controller 102 generates, for each scent delivery unit 104, command data that is
made up of a series of on and off commands, where the frequency and duration of the
on and off periods are based on the specified cycle time and duty cycle of each scenting
unit, and transmits this data in real-time to the corresponding scent delivery units. In
response to this command data, each scent delivery unit 104 may simply turn on (i.e.,
deliver scent) in real-time in response to and upon receiving a "turn ON" command and
turns off (i.e., not deliver scent) in real-time in response to and upon receiving a "turn
OFF" command. Alternatively, the central controller 102 may generate, for each scent
delivery unit 104, a single turn ON command that corresponds to a scheduled activation
and a single turn OFF command that corresponds to a scheduled deactivation. Under
this type of control scheme, the scent delivery unit 104 may be configured to constantly
deliver scent during the period of activation, instead of being turned on and off
successively according to a duty cycle.
[0037]     In other implementations, the central controller 102 can generate and transmit
command data that contains all required information for each scent delivery unit 104 to
perform as scheduled (e.g., transmits command data directing the unit to activate from
 1:30pm to 3:30pm on Wednesday, July 7th using a scent cycle time of 300 seconds and
a 50% scent duty cycle). Each scent delivery unit 104 can receive and independently
act on a command to activate during a certain time period at a specified scent level.
                                                 9

    WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
 Notably, in these implementations, the scent delivery units 104 may have additional
processing and memory capabilities that enable them to process the more complex
command data received from the central controller 102. Also, the scent delivery unit
 104 may be configured to synchronize its activation and deactivation schedules with
those of the other scent delivery units 104.
[0038]     Because each scent unit 104 may be associated with an optimal base scent
setting (e.g., cycle time and duty cycle), the user may schedule the desired activation
time of a unit, for example by creating a scheduled event, without having to specify any
of the parameters of the base scent setting (e.g., cycle time and/or the duty cycle) for
the scheduled event. In this case, the central controller 102 may simply generate
command data to reflect the desired activation time and the base scent setting
associated with the unit. In other cases, the generated command data may not include
any information about the base scent setting parameters (e.g., cycle time and/or the
duty cycle), with the unit itself being configured to simply operate during the desired
activation time according to its optimal base scent setting.
[0039]     In other implementations, the user may wish to create a scheduled event that
deviates from the base scent setting for a machine. For example, the user may walk
through the lobby during a particular scheduled activation time and feel that the scent
provided by a particular machine is too weak (i.e., should be perceived as being
stronger). In this case, the user may access the central controller 102 and update the
base scent setting for the responsible machine to, for example, have a higher scent
level (e.g., by increasing the duty cycle). This, however, may impact other scheduled
scenting events that use the same machine, which may be undesirable. Alternatively,
the user may access the central controller 102 and update just the particular scheduled
event during which the stronger scent is desired. Notably, unlike sound, light,
temperature, etc., which have a desired setpoint that can be easily quantified (e.g.,
decibel, lumen, degree Celsius, etc.), the desired perception of scent may be harder to
define. Accordingly, instead of setting an absolute scent setpoint, the user may, for
example, associate the particular scheduled event with a positive or negative scent level
bias to increase or decrease, respectively, the associated duty cycle relative to the base
scent setting. Other scheduled events that control the same machine without indicating
                                               10

    WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
this bias will continue to operate according to the base scent setting associated with the
machine. The scheduled events may indicate the bias either directly or indirectly.
[0040]     As noted above, the base scent setting of each machine (e.g. cycle time and
duty cycle) may be set at the time of installation and may be optimized in view of the
machine's location, scent type, etc. For example, the manufacturer, at the time of
installation, may carefully analyze the particular scenting environment - through trial and
error, internally developed metrics, instrumented analysis, or use of a professional
perfumer, just to name a few methods - to come up with the ideal base scent setting for
a particular machine. However, during normal usage, a user may want to deviate from
the base scent setting depending on, for example, dynamic variables specific to a given
scent event (e.g., number of people in the room during the event, HVAC settings during
the event, etc.). Such dynamic variables may not have been present or otherwise
considered during the time of installation. As such, the user may schedule a desired
scent event in consideration of such dynamic variables by simply determining the
appropriate bias value relative to the base scent level - without altering the base scent
level itself.
[0041]     In other implementations, the user may wish to change, for example, the scent
levels (e.g., by changing the duty cycle) of multiple machines, where each machine may
be configured, via the base scent setting, to operate at different cycle times and/or duty
cycles. In this implementation, as detailed further below, the user may indicate a single
scent level bias that will correspondingly alter the scent levels (e.g., duty cycles) of the
multiple machines while preserving their base scent settings. In most cases, a duty
cycle of the machines may be variable in the range between around 5% to around 95%.
[0042]     FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process 200 in which a system may alter a
scent level of a scent delivery unit during a particular activation period without
permanently altering the associated base scent setting. Briefly, the process 200
includes receiving input addressing the activation of a scent delivery unit along with an
associated scent level bias (202), and retrieving the base scent setting associated with
said scent delivery unit (204). Based on the received input and the retrieved base scent
setting, the system generates command data to activate the scent delivery unit by
                                              11

    WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
applying the received scent level bias to the retrieved base scent setting (206). The
generated command data is then sent to the scent delivery unit (208).
[0043]     Here, generating command data may include generating a set of machine
specific instructions that incorporates all scheduled events for a given machine and
instructs said machine when to turn on and off. In some implementations, the
generated command data may be stored in a machine-specific table of instructions that
does not lead to conflicting machine behavior. In some implementations, generating
command data may include updating and/or revising the master schedule of events to
eliminate instances of conflicting machine behavior.
[0044]     Sending command data may include transmitting the generated command
data to the one or more scent delivery units across a network (e.g., network 106). In
some implementations, the command data may be sent in real-time as they are
generated. Alternatively, or additionally, the command data may be sent at
predetermined time intervals, e.g., once every minute. In some cases, the command
data may be sent in response to and upon receiving instructions from the user. In other
cases, the command data may be sent in response to and upon receiving a query for
instructions, e.g., from the scent delivery unit.
[0045]     In one implementation example, the process 200 of FIG. 2 may be
implemented by the system 100 of FIG. 1. In this implementation, the central controller
102 may receive input addressing the activation of a scent delivery unit under a scent
level bias (202) when the user schedules a scenting event that includes the scent
delivery unit and further indicates that a bias should be applied for the particular event.
For example, a user-entered scheduled event may indicate that the first scent delivery
unit should be activated every Monday from 9:00am to 5:00pm under a +15 bias.
Particular values that may be associated with the bias will be discussed further below;
however, the positive value in this example indicates that the user desires a higher
scent level during the indicated activation period. The higher desired scent level may
indicate that the user wants to perceive a stronger scent during the noted activation
period compared to other activation periods for the same machine. Alternatively, or
additionally, the higher desired scent level may indicate that the user wants to perceive
the same strength of the scent during the noted activation period as in other activation
                                              12

    WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
periods for the same machine, but that particular conditions of the scenting environment
during the noted activation period require a higher scent level to achieve the same
perceived effect. For example, there may be higher foot traffic during the noted
activation period. In some cases, the user-entered scheduled event may indicate that a
group of scent delivery units should be activated as scheduled. Either way, before the
scent delivery unit can be activated according to the user input, the central controller
102 will need to determine what command data should be sent to the scent delivery
unit.
[0046]    In operation 204, the central controller 102 retrieves the base scent setting of
the scent delivery unit from operation 202. Because the scent level bias information
received in operation 202 indicates a relative increase/decrease as opposed to an
absolute setpoint, the central controller 102 may need to know the base scent setting in
order to generate the appropriate command data. In some implementations, the central
controller 102 may include or otherwise have access to a database that stores the
information pertaining to each scent delivery unit, including its base scent setting. In
some cases, the central controller 102 may obtain such information directly from the
individual scent delivery units. In some cases, each scheduled event may be pre
loaded with the base scent setting information for each machine included in the
scheduled event, and this information may be passed onto the central controller 102
along with the received input addressing the machine's activation.
[0047]    The central controller 102 will proceed to generate, in operation 206,
command data to activate the scent delivery unit in a manner that accounts for the scent
level bias. For example, if the central controller 102 receives input, in operation 202,
from a newly entered scheduled event indicating that a particular scent delivery unit
should be activated daily from 1:00pm to 6:00pm under a scent level bias of +15, and if
the central controller 102 knows, from operation 204, that this particular scent delivery
unit is associated with a base scent setting having a cycle time of 300 seconds and a
duty cycle of 50%, then the central controller 102 will generate command data that
applies the +15 bias to the duty cycle of 50%. In this example, the central controller 102
may simply add 15 percentage points to the base duty cycle of 50%. Accordingly, the
command data will indicate that the noted scent delivery unit should activate daily from
                                              13

   WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
1:00pm to 6:00pm, and that during this activation period, the scent delivery unit should
turn on and off successively for periods of 195 seconds and 105 seconds, respectively.
[0048]    In some implementations, the central controller 102 may use an arithmetic
function in applying the scent level bias to the base scent level. For example, a +15
bias may simply be added to a base duty cycle of 50%, thereby yielding a revised duty
cycle of 65% (i.e., 50 +15) for the generated command data. Alternatively, or
additionally, the central controller 102 may use a geometric function in applying the
scent level bias to the base scent level. For example, a +15 bias may indicate a
percentage increase to the base duty cycle of 50%, thereby yielding a revised duty
cycle of 57.5% (i.e., 50 x 1.15) for the generated command data.
[0049]    In some implementations, the scent level bias, as inputted by the user, may be
applied in a different manner by the central controller 102 depending on a machine
specific parameter and a pre-defined algorithm related to said parameter. In one
implementation, prior to being applied to the base scent level, the scent level bias may
be scaled up or down by a known amount in accordance with an algorithm. For
example, a machine having one type of a scent may have the full bias applied to its
base scent level, while a different machine having a different type of a scent may have
only half of the bias applied to its base scent level. In some cases, the scaling factor for
the scent level bias may vary depending on the base scent level. For example, the
scaling factor may be inversely proportional to the base scent level. In other
implementations, the scaling factor for the scent level bias may vary according to a
known calibration curve for each machine and/or scent type.
[0050]    As noted above, the duty cycle may be varied between around 5% to around
95%. In some cases, each scent delivery unit may be associated with its own range of
duty cycle. In either case, if applying a scent level bias to the base scent level of a
particular machine would result in that machine's duty cycle going beyond the specified
range, the central controller 102 may instead generate, for that particular machine,
command data that corresponds to the maximum or minimum specified duty cycle. In
some cases, when a scheduled event controls activation of multiple machines under a
single scent level bias, the central controller 102 may generate command data for all
                                              14

    WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
machines based on a reduced scent level bias that would not push any of the machines
beyond the specified range of duty cycle.
[0051]     FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate a series of exemplary graphical user interface (GUI)
windows 300, 400, and 402 associated with the scent delivery system 100. The
graphical windows 300, 400, and 402 may be provided by the user interface component
of the central controller 102 and may be accessed by one or more users over, for
example, the World Wide Web using a browser application resident on one or more of
the user devices 108.
[0052]     Referring to FIG. 3, the graphical window 300 illustrates how data pertaining to
a particular scent delivery unit may be entered. The data may be maintained in a
database contained within or otherwise accessible to the central controller 102 and may
be accessed and/or updated by one or more users, for example, through use of one or
more of the user devices 108 across the network 106. The particular types and styles
of GUI input elements, i.e., entry boxes, check boxes, pull-down menus, etc., as
depicted in the exemplary windows are for illustrative purposes only and may be altered
as necessary depending on system requirements, user preferences, scenting
environment, etc.
[0053]    The graphical window 300 illustrates data entry pertaining to a scent delivery
unit named "MachineA," as indicated in entry box 302. In the same window 300 or in
another interface, the name MachineA may further be associated with a network
address or the like such that the central controller 102 may send command data thereto
in order to control MachineA as dictated by the master schedule.
[0054]     In pull-down box 304, the scent type associated with MachineA may be
identified. While the actual scent type that MachineA is able to emit will be determined
by what particular scent or scents are physically installed in the machine, entering the
scent information here will enable the central controller 102 to keep track of which
machine is configured to which scent. This information may inform the machine
relatedness determination noted below.
[0055]     In similar fashion, pull-down box 306 can be used to identify the particular
location associated with MachineA. While the actual location of MachineA is
determined by where the machine is physically located, entering the scent information
                                              15

    WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
here will enable the central controller 102 to keep track of where each machine is
located. This information also may inform the machine-relatedness determination noted
below.
[0056]      Entry boxes 308 and 310 may identify, respectively, the desired scent cycle
time and scent level percentage for MachineA. Here, scent cycle time refers to the
period of time during which one on-off cycle occurs while scent level percentage refers
to the percentage of time during the cycle time in which the machine is turned ON (i.e.,
duty cycle). In some cases, data entries 308 and 310 indicate a base scent setting for
the specified delivery unit that reflects an optimal setting for the particular unit. In some
cases, the base scent setting for each machine may be determined automatically by the
central controller 102. For example, the particular scent type and/or location as
selected in pull-down boxes 304 and 306 may be pre-associated with a corresponding
base scent setting, the information regarding which the central controller 102 may be
configured to store or otherwise access.
[0057]      Check box 312 may be used to indicate whether the associated scent delivery
unit, in this case Machine_A, is enabled. For example, checking "NO" for check box
312 may effectively take MachineA offline, allowing the central controller 102 to ignore
any input concerning the activation of MachineA. A user may not want a unit to be
enabled, for example, during repair of the unit and/or during scent cartridge
replacement.
[0058]      Check box 314 may be used to indicate a mode of operation, or run mode, of
the particular machine. Here, "automatic" may refer to the mode in which the machine
is operated in accordance with the master schedule as maintained by the central
controller 102. Accordingly, MachineA in this case will activate and deactivate based
on conflict-free command data generated by the central controller 102. Setting the run
mode to "ON" or "OFF" may be akin to manual override of the machine. In other words,
selecting ON for entry 314 will immediately activate the machine regardless of the
activation/deactivation schedule contained in the master schedule. Likewise, selecting
OFF for entry 314 will immediately deactivate the machine regardless of the master
schedule. During a manual ON or OFF period, scheduled events to the contrary may
not be permitted by the central controller 102. In other words, a manual control will
                                               16

    WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
 have, under this scheme, priority over any previously or subsequently added scheduled
events.
 [0059]   As with scheduled events, immediate requests for activation and/or
deactivation may be sent by the central controller 102 as command data. In some
cases, "automatic" may be a default setting for check box 314 to which the selection will
revert back after a period of time. For example, any selections of either ON or OFF may
reset back to "automatic" every day at midnight, thereby returning the machine to
automatic, scheduled control. Accordingly, while disabling the machine via entry 312
and manually turning off the machine via entry 314 can both effectively take the
machine offline, turning off the machine via entry 314 will allow it to automatically revert
back to automatic mode after a period of time.
[0060]    Referring again to the graphical window 300 in FIG. 3, pull-down box 316 may
be used to indicate a group to which a particular machine may belong. As discussed
further below in relation to the scheduling process, grouping multiple machines into a
group may allow the user to quickly schedule a larger number of machines without
having to enter a separate event for each machine. Alternatively, or additionally, a
separate interface may be used to define various groups and the machines contained
therein.
[0061]    Pull-down box 318 may be used to input information regarding related units,
which will be discussed further below. Alternatively, or additionally, an additional user
interface may be provided to allow the user to choose which units are related. Entry
box 320 may be used to input information regarding fail safe time, which will be
discussed further below.
[0062]    In some implementations, any authenticated user may access the window 300
and change the data corresponding to all or some of the GUI input elements in the
window 300. In other implementations, only an authenticated system administrator user
can access the window 300 and change the data corresponding to all or some of the
GUI input elements in the window 300. In these implementations, the other
authenticated users may not be allowed to access the window 300, may be allowed to
access the window 300 but may not be allowed to change the data displayed in the
windows, or may be allowed to access the window 300 but may only change the data
                                             17

     WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
corresponding to a subset of the GUI input elements (e.g., can only change the run
mode using check box 314).
[0063]     FIG. 4 shows an example GUI that includes graphical windows 400 and 402
for creating scheduled events. In some implementations, any authenticated user that
wishes to schedule a scenting event may interact with windows 400 and 402 using a
user device 108 to schedule a scenting event. In other implementations, only an
authenticated system administrator user is able to interact with windows 400 and 402
using a user device 108 to schedule a scenting event. In some implementations, any
authenticated user that wishes to schedule a scenting event may interact with windows
400 and 402 using a user device 108 to provide scenting event schedule data to the
central controller 102 but only authenticated system administrator users may interact
with window 300 to provide unit-specific information to the central controller 102.
[0064]     As illustrated, the graphical window 400 creates a scheduled event called
"Schedule 1'" (404) for MachineA while the graphical window 402 creates a scheduled
event called "Schedule 1" (424) for the same MachineA. The user may create
additional scheduled events as needed for MachineA as well as other scent delivery
units in the system 100 by opening a scheduled event interface for each new event
desired. In this example, information pertaining to MachineA corresponds to
information entered for the same machine through interactions with the graphical
window 300 in FIG. 3.
[0065]     In further detail, by making selections in event type check boxes 406, 426, the
user can indicate the desired type of a scheduled event. For example, a "calendar" type
event can allow the user to choose days of the month as well as particular times of day
during which machine or machines identified in pull-down boxes 410, 430 should be
activated. A "weekly" type event, on the other hand, can allow the user to choose days
of the week as well as particular times of day during which machine or machines
identified in pull-down boxes 410, 430 should be activated. A weekly event, because it
can be repeated week to week, may also be referred to as a recurring event. As
illustrated in the graphical windows 400, 402, selecting the "weekly" option in entry 406
can cause the windows 400, 402 to display check boxes 412, 432 that allow the user to
specify days of the week during which the machine or machines should be activated.

    WO 2015/006463                                                       PCT/US2014/045977
The "on time" entries 414, 434 and "off time" entries 416, 436 indicate, respectively, the
time at which the machine or machines should be activated and at which they should be
deactivated. In some cases, each graphical window may include multiple on/off times to
specify multiple activation periods in a single day.
[0066]     In addition to allowing the user to specify operating conditions for individual
machine or machines, group/unit check boxes 408, 428 can allow the user to specify
operating conditions for a group of machines. For example, choosing "unit" in entry
sections 408, 428 may cause pull-down menus 410, 430 to list all networked scent
delivery units. As discussed further below with respect to FIG. 8, choosing "group" in
entry sections 408, 428 may cause pull-down menus 410, 430 to instead list all groups
of machines previously identified. This way, multiple scent delivery units associated
with a group (e.g., a "Lobby Group" that includes all machines located in the lobby) may
be quickly scheduled through a single scheduled event.
[0067]     The bias setting entry boxes 418, 438 allow the user to input the desired scent
level bias. A scent level bias of 0 indicates that the scheduled event should proceed at
a scent level (e.g., duty cycle) associated with the base scent setting. A positive or a
negative scent level bias indicates that the scheduled event should proceed at a scent
level that is higher or lower, respectively, in relation to the scent level associated with
the base scent setting. In some implementations, the numerical value of the scent level
bias may correspond to a percentage change to the duty cycle associated with the base
scent setting, which may be applied either arithmetically and/or geometrically as
discussed above. In some implementations, the numerical value of the scent level bias
may be an arbitrary value whose specific effects on the scent level may be determined
by the central controller 102, or in some cases by the scent delivery units themselves,
according to a pre-defined control logic. In some implementations, the numerical value
of the scent level bias may correspond to a time value, for example a time change in
seconds to be applied to a length of the ON cycle. Alternatively or additionally, the
scent level bias may be applied to fan speed, nozzle pressure, compressor power,
and/or other machine-specific parameters that may in other ways influence total number
of scent particles released in an environment during a given amount of time.

[0068]     Check boxes 420, 440 may be used to indicate whether or not the instant
scheduled event is an anti-event, as will be discussed further below.
 [0069]    FIG. 5 shows a graphical representation of two scheduled events 500, 502 as
created through the exemplary GUI windows 400, 402 (FIG. 4). Reference is also made
to information about MachineA as mentioned in the example of FIG. 3. In some
implementations, the central controller 102 is able to provide event-specific graphical
representation to a user device 108 to enable the device 108 to display a GUI to the
user that includes figures graphically depicting each scheduled event. Such figures
enable a user to quickly, at-a-glance, see and compare the various scheduled events.
[0070]     As shown in FIG. 5, scheduled events Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 include,
respectively, event-specific machine data 504, 506. Representation of events 500, 502
also indicate the scent level bias that was included in the scheduled events, in this case
0 and +15, respectively. Here, the machine data 504, 506 represent information that
the central controller 102 will use to generate appropriate command data. As such,
data 504, 506 reflects an application of the scent level bias to the base scent setting.
For example, the central controller 102 may generate command data for Machine_A,
which has a base duty cycle of 50% (FIG. 3), that corresponds to a 50% duty cycle in
Schedule 1 and a 65% duty cycle in Schedule 2. The base scent setting for Machine_A
in either of the exemplary scenarios will remain unchanged (i.e., scent time of 120 sec.
and duty cycle of 50%).
[0071]     FIG. 6 shows a plot 600 illustrating duty cycle-based scent cycling that would
occur during an activation period of MachineA under Schedule 1 (602) and under
Schedule 2 (604). As shown, a positive scent level bias has the effect of increasing the
ON time for each cycle while decreasing the OFF time.
[0072]     In some implementations, the central controller 102 may automatically add a
period of rest after an activation period to, for example, allow any lingering scent to
sufficiently dissipate before scent from the next event is emitted. For example, referring
to Schedule 2 form FIG. 4, the central controller 102 may automatically add a rest
period at 9pm (e.g., 2 minutes) so that subsequent scenting events taking place in the
same location are delayed. As such, a scent event scheduled to run from 9pm to 11pm
in the same location as Schedule 2 may be revised to instead run from 9:02pm to 11pm.

     WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
This way, the added rest time may allow scent particles from Schedule 2 to sufficiently
dissipate from the scenting environment before scent particles from the next scheduled
event are introduced into the same space.
[0073]     A length of the automatically added rest period, as described above, may vary
according to a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, scent type, dissipative
properties of scent particles, length of activation period, type of room being scented, etc.
Based on one or more such factors, the central controller 102 may be configured to
automatically calculate the appropriate rest period using a predefined algorithm. For
example, a small room with high foot traffic (e.g., lobby) may require less rest period
than a large open space (e.g., ballroom). Similarly, a short activation period may
require less rest period than a long activation period. Additionally, or alternatively, the
central controller 102 may be configured to automatically calculate and implement the
appropriate length of rest based on the scent level bias of the preceding event. For
example, a scenting event operated under a high positive bias may require a longer rest
period compared to an event operated under a high negative bias.
[0074]     Referring to FIG. 7, a GUI window 700 shows multiple scent delivery units that
may be associated with a single group, in this case Group1. Referring also to FIG. 8,
windows 800, 802 illustrate how two scheduled events, Schedule 1 and Schedule 2,
may be created by designating groups of machines, instead of individual machines as
illustrated in the example of FIG. 4. Each scent delivery unit may be associated with
multiple groups.
[0075]     To create scheduled events for groups, entries 804-840 in graphical windows
800, 802 may be completed in much the same manner as described above with respect
to windows 400, 402 in FIG. 4. Check boxes 808, 828 should, however, indicate that a
"group" is being selected instead of a "unit." Making this selection in boxes 808, 828 will
cause pull-down boxes 810, 830 to list all groups as identified by the central controller
102. In this example, "Group1" may be chosen in entries 810, 830 to indicate that all
machines listed in window 700 should be controlled for this scheduled event. The bias
setting entry 818, 838 may be completed as before to indicate the desired scent level
bias for all machines in the group.

[0076]     FIG. 9 shows a graphical representation of two scheduled events 900, 902 as
created through the exemplary GUI windows 800, 802 (FIG. 8). Reference is also made
to information about individual units of Group1 as given in FIG. 7.
[0077]    As shown in FIG. 5, scheduled events Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 include,
respectively, event-specific group data 904, 916, each of which contains event-specific
machine data 906-910 and 914-918, respectively. Representation of events 900, 902
also indicate the scent level bias that was included in the scheduled events, in this case
0 and +15, respectively. Here, the group data 904, 916 represent information that the
central controller 102 will use to generate appropriate command data. As such, the
group data 904, 916 reflect an application of the scent level bias to the base scent
settings of each machine in the group.
[0078]     Referring to FIG. 10, a block diagram 1000 illustrates an exemplary
implementation of the central controller 102 (FIG. 1). As shown, exemplary central
controller may be largely divided into two components: scheduler 1002 and database
1004. Here, the scheduler 1002 is mainly responsible for the scheduling and controlling
of individual scent delivery units while the database 1004 stores or otherwise makes
accessible data pertaining to each scent delivery unit in the system. For example,
contents of the window 300 (FIG. 3) and window 700 (FIG. 7) may be stored and
maintained in the database 1004.
[0079]     In further detail, the scheduler 1002 can include a schedule control section
1006 and a scent delivery unit control section 1010. In this implementation, the
schedule control section 1006 is configured to receive the desired scheduling
information from the user, e.g., via one or more scheduled events, and communicate
with the database 1004 as needed to retrieve data pertaining to the scent delivery unit
referred to in the one or more scheduled events. For example, in response to the entry
of the scheduled event shown in graphical window 400 (FIG. 4), the scheduler control
section 1006 may query the database 1004 to find out the network location of
MachineA.
[0080]    The schedule control section 1006 may be configured to perform a bias
applying process, such as process 200 (FIG. 2), in order to generate command data
that changes the instant scent level of scent delivery units without changing their base
                                               22

     WO 2015/006463                                                        PCT/US2014/045977
scent settings. In one implementation, the generated command data may be in the form
of a list of instructions for each scent delivery unit in the networked system 100. For
example, in reference to FIG. 4, the list of instructions for MachineA under Schedule 1
may include (i) turning on at 9:30am and (ii) turning off at 2:30pm. Similarly, referring
again to FIG. 4, the list of instructions for MachineA under Schedule 2 may include (i)
turning on at 3:00pm under a +15 scent level bias and (ii) turning off at 9:00pm. The
schedule control section 1006 may then output this list of instructions to an out table
1008. The out table 1008 can be configured to store the updated list of instructions for
each machine in the system. The out table 1008 may be updated following the addition,
deletion, and/or revision of a scheduled event. Alternatively, or additionally, the
schedule control section 1006 may update the out table 1008 periodically according to a
pre-determined schedule (e.g. every minute) regardless of whether any changes were
made to the scheduled events.
[0081]     In another implementation, the out table 1008 may include real-time
instructions for the scent delivery units. That is, the list of instructions may simply
instruct the machine to, for example, turn on and start operating at the given cycle time
and duty cycle. In response, the machine may continue to operate at the given duty
cycle until a subsequent instruction received from the out table 1008 instructs the
machine to turn off. In this implementation, the scent delivery units may require minimal
intelligence and functionality.
[0082]     The scent delivery unit control section 1010 may be configured to directly
implement a communication protocol between the central controller and the individual
scent delivery units. For example, the scent delivery unit control section 1010 may be
configured to simply read off instructions from the out table 1008 and broadcast them
one by one to each of the network-controlled scent delivery units. In some cases, the
scent delivery unit control section 1010 may be configured to verify proper data
communication by receiving verification signals from the individual scent units. Such
verification signals may be received and stored in an in table 1012. The in table 1012
may send or otherwise make accessible the verification information to the schedule
control section 1006, such that a user may receive real-time status updates of each
machine out in the field.
                                               23

     WO 2015/006463                                                       PCT/US2014/045977
[0083]      As noted above, a master schedule can refer to an aggregate of all scheduled
events and may be maintained by the central controller 102. In one implementation,
master schedule data is updated by user input at unpredictable times (e.g., when the
user decides to add/update/remove a scheduled event). Updated master schedule data
may then be processed by the schedule control section 1006 in real-time (e.g., once
every few seconds), in response to and upon detection of user input of a new or
modified scheduled scenting event, or at predetermined time intervals (e.g., once every
5 minutes) to generate/update non-conflicting machine-specific instruction tables. The
machine-specific instruction tables are a list or grouping of instructions with
corresponding execution time information for a specific machine. The machine-specific
instruction tables for all machines in the system may be aggregated into the out table
1008. The instructions for a corresponding machine's operation included in a particular
machine-specific instruction table may indicate operations that need to be performed by
the machine over a relatively long period of time (e.g., a day, a week, or a month).
[0084]      In one implementation, the scent delivery unit control section 1010 receives
the out table 1008, which contains the non-conflicting machine-specific instruction
tables, and sends out each machine instruction (e.g., "turn on" instruction) at its
appropriate time to each respective machine based on the out table 1008 (e.g., by
processing the table). The delivery of an instruction may occur in real-time (e.g., a "turn
on" instruction is sent in real-time, which results in the machine turning on in response
to and upon receipt of the instruction). This implementation allows scent delivery units
with little intelligence to be used. However, this implementation may also have greater
sensitivity to connection failures, given that it may require a relatively continual and
uninterrupted connection between the central controller and the units to operate
properly.
[0085]      In an alternative implementation, delivery of instructions from the scent
delivery unit control section 1010 may occur ahead of time (e.g., a "turn on at 6pm"
instruction being sent at 5pm). In some cases, the scent delivery unit control section
1010 may simply send the non-conflicting machine-specific tables (or the updated
portions of the same) to each of their respective machines for processing. In these
cases, the machines are intelligent units able to process the tables with their own
                                              24

      WO 2015/006463                                                    PCT/US2014/045977
 internal and synchronized clocks. This implementation may be less sensitive to
connection errors because the instructions generally do not need to be continually sent
 in real-time for proper operation. This implementation, however, requires more
intelligent scent delivery units that have additional processing capabilities to process the
instructions at their appropriate times in synchronicity with the other scent delivery units
(e.g., scent delivery units that each have their own clock that may include circuitry to
synchronize the clock with the clocks of the other scent delivery units and that each
have the processing capabilities to interpret and execute more complex received
instructions).
[0086]      In some implementations, updated master schedule data may be processed
by the schedule control section 1006 in real-time (e.g., once every few seconds) in
response to and upon detection of user input of a new or modified scheduled scenting
event, or at predetermined time intervals (e.g., once every 5 minutes) to
generate/update a second version of the master schedule that is non-conflicting.
 Notably, in some implementations, this second version may be saved as separate data
from the conflicting master schedule data to allow the conflicting master schedule data
to be preserved intact for subsequent processing based on new user input. In other
implementations, the second version may overwrite the master schedule data and
become a new master schedule data used for future processing based on new user
input. These implementations, however, may be less preferable in that they may limit
the ability to recover the original user-inputted scenting event data when conflicts
subsequently change (e.g., go away) as a result of subsequent user input.
[0087]      In some implementations, the updated, non-conflicting master schedule data
may be sent directly by the scent delivery unit control section 1010 to each scent
delivery unit for processing. Each scent delivery unit in this implementation has
intelligence to directly process the master schedule at clock times that are synchronized
with that of the other units.
[0088]      In some implementations, the schedule control section 1006 may process the
updated, non-conflicting master schedule data (i.e., the second version of the master
schedule data) to generate non-conflicting machine-specific instruction tables that are
subsequently sent to each respective machine. Here, no conflict-resolving processes
                                               25

      WO 2015/006463                                                   PCT/US2014/045977
are required to generate the machine-specific instruction tables since the master
schedule itself has been updated to be conflict-free. As described above, such
machine-specific instructions may be sent out in real-time to less intelligent scent
delivery units or may be sent out ahead of time to more intelligent scent delivery units.
[0089]     FIG. 11 is a flowchart of an example process 1100 in which the central
controller may command scent delivery to activate under a scent level bias. While
process 1100 may be implemented by various systems, explanation of the exemplary
process 1100 is given in relation to the controller described in FIG. 10.
[0090]     The schedule control section 1006 is configured to receive input addressing
the desired activation of a scent delivery unit under a scent level bias (1102). For
example, as illustrated in graphical window 402 (FIG. 4), a scheduled event that
includes the desired scent level bias (i.e., bias setting), may be received by the
schedule control section 1006.
[0091]     Based on the received input and the retrieved base scent setting, the schedule
control section 1006 generates command data to activate the scent delivery unit by
applying the received scent level bias to the retrieved base scent setting (1106).
[0092]     The generated command data is subsequently sent to the scent delivery unit
by the scent delivery unit control section 1010 (1108). In some cases, the command
data may be in the form of network packets or other suitable data formats that can be
communicated across the network 106. The one or more scent delivery units 104 are
configured to receive such data (1110) and operate (i.e., turn on or off) based on the
received data (1112). In some implementations, the one or more scent delivery units
may send a confirmation signal back to the scent delivery unit control section 1010
(1114), to indicate, for example, that the sent data has been properly received and/or
that the machines are functioning properly. The scent delivery unit control section 1010
may then update the current status of each machine by, for example, appropriately
populating the in table 1012 (1116). In some cases, the command data may be in the
form of a signal that is a waveform and may include multiple transitions in signal level
that correspond to changes in the on/off state of the corresponding scent delivery unit.
 In some cases, the signal may be a pulse that corresponds to a change in the on/off
state of the corresponding scent delivery unit.

[0093]     FIG. 12 shows an exemplary scent delivery unit 1200. The scent delivery unit
1200 may be used as a standalone system, or may be used as part of the networked
scent delivery system 100. Briefly, the scent delivery unit 1200 includes a diffusion
head 1202 that is mounted on a cartridge bottle 1204. Scented liquid is stored within
the bottle 1204 and can be atomized into the atmosphere via the head 1202. The
diffusion head 1202 may comprise a venturi-type atomizer.
[0094]     In one implementation, each scent delivery unit 104 includes a scent reservoir
and an atomizing device in fluid communication with the scent reservoir. In one
example, the scent reservoir is a cartridge bottle containing scented liquid, for example
a fragrant oil mixture having a desired scent for the particular scent delivery unit 104.
The atomizing device can be, for example, a venturi-type atomizer that uses a high
velocity airstream generated within a control unit 1206 to draw in and atomize the liquid
in the cartridge bottle 1204 into small particles (e.g., under 10 microns in diameter) that
can be dispersed into the air via a nozzle 1208. The control unit 1206 may include a
network receiver or the like to receive command data sent by the central controller 102
(FIG. 1).
[0095]     FIG. 13 shows an alternative scent delivery unit 1300. The scent delivery unit
1300 may be a canister type machine that includes a wicking structure impregnated with
fragrance material. Airflow through the scent delivery unit 1300, for example generated
by an on-board fan, can help evaporate and release the fragrance into the environment.
Control electronics, network receiver, and other electrical/mechanical components may
be included within a casing of the scent delivery unit 1300.
[0096]     Scent delivery units 1200 and 1300 represent just two of many different types
of scent delivery technologies that may be used with the scent delivery system 100.
Other types of scent delivery technologies may include evaporative systems based on
natural convection. Evaporative systems may use scents from fragrance carriers such
as liquid fragrance oil suspended in porous media including, but not limited to,
woven/non-woven fabrics, papers felts, wood-like materials, porous plastics, foams,
sponges, screens and wool-like materials. In some cases, fragrant compounds used in
evaporative systems may be incorporated in semi-solids such as gels or may be
absorbed into the intermolecular structure of nonporous materials such as plastic
                                              27

      WO 2015/006463                                                       PCT/US2014/045977
beads, fibers, or films. Evaporative systems may release scent when fragrance
carriers/evaporative media contained therein are exposed to air. Scent delivery
technologies may also include forced convection-type devices that rely on forced
convection produced by fans or directed compressed air (e.g., from pumps or
pressurized tanks) to enhance the release of scent from the above-noted evaporated
media. Alternatively or additionally, heat energy (e.g., radiant heat from a candle or
convective heat from a heated blower) may be incorporated to increase the rate of
fragrance evaporation. Scent delivery technologies may also include direct diffusion
type devices where fragrance compounds are directly diffused into the air through
various forms of atomizers to produce a wide range of desired particle sizes. An
atomizer may be in the form of hydraulic spray nozzles configured to directly release
high-velocity liquids, liquid-liquid impinging atomizers configured to collide liquid
streams, and air-liquid impinging atomizers such as bubble tanks, airblast atomizers,
prefiliming atomizers, and venturi-type atomizers. An atomizer may be a mechanical
atomizer that relies on spinning discs or vibrating structures, for example, to deliver
scent. For example, piezoelectric transducers may be used to atomize liquid oils via
ultrasonic surface wave effects, or through the use of microscopically perforated
vibrating mesh (VMT). In some cases, high voltage can be used in an electrospray
device, where electrostatic forces can cause the expulsion and dispersal of tiny volumes
of liquid from a single fine orifice or a brush like structure of multiple points. Notably,
any scent delivery unit is configured to deliver scent at a variable scent level by being
turned on and off successively according to a variable duty cycle if it delivers scent at a
variable scent level by being turned on and off successively according to a variable duty
cycle, regardless of whether it is specially configured for such operation or whether it is
instead designed for use without duty cycle variations.
[0097]      A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be
understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit
and scope of the disclosure.
[0098]      For example, while the above-described implementations assume a single unit
or machine corresponds to a single, physical piece of equipment that produces a single
scent (e.g., Unit A may correspond to a single, physical scent delivery machine that
                                               28

     WO 2015/006463                                                      PCT/US2014/045977
includes a single cartridge bottle containing a single Pineapple scent), it should be
understood that in other implementations a single, physical piece of equipment may be
configured to produce many different scents, either concurrently and/or serially, and,
therefore, may correspond to multiple different of the above-described machines or
units (e.g., Unit A corresponds to the first cartridge bottle of a single physical piece of
equipment that contains a Pineapple scent and Unit B corresponds to a second
cartridge bottle of the same single physical piece of equipment that is configured to
produce a leather scent). Accordingly, in implementations in which a single, physical
piece of equipment may deliver different scents (e.g., through different cartridges), the
single, physical piece of equipment may be treated as if it were multiple of the above
described different units or machines. In such implementations, a machine may refer to
the single, physical piece of equipment while a unit may refer to each of the
corresponding above-described different units or machines that may be collocated,
sharing the same power and same HVAC, emitting a different, single scent, etc.
Additionally, while the above-described implementations assume a scent delivery unit or
a machine includes one or more of the above-noted scent delivery technologies, it
should be noted that the scent delivery unit or machine may correspond to any element,
including hoses, nozzles, and orifices, that can deliver scent in accordance with a
schedule maintained by the central controller.
[0099]    In another implementation, a scent level bias may result in command data that
reflects a change to both the cycle time as well as the duty cycle associated with a base
scent setting of a particular scent delivery unit. That is, applying a scent level bias to
the base scent setting of a particular scent delivery unit may include activating the unit
under an altered duty cycle as well as under an altered cycle time. For example, a
scent delivery unit having a base cycle time of 600 seconds and a base duty cycle of
50% might typically operate, without any scent level bias, by successively turning on for
300 seconds and turning off for 300 seconds. In response to a scent level bias of +45,
the command data for activating the unit may then indicate that the unit should operate
under a cycle of 570 seconds of ON time and 30 seconds of OFF time, reflecting in this
case increasing the duty cycle to 95% while keeping the cycle time the same. In some
cases, however, the user may prefer that this unit not stay on continuously for more
                                              29

     WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
than, as an example, 540 seconds (i.e., maximum ON time), for example to prevent
overheating. In such a case, the command data may be adjusted accordingly to take
into account both the +45 bias as well as the 540 second maximum ON time. To
achieve this, the command data may indicate that the unit should operate under a cycle
of 540 seconds of ON time and 28.4 seconds of OFF time, reflecting in this case
increasing the duty cycle time to 95%, as before, but also simultaneously decreasing
the cycle time from 600 seconds to 568.4 seconds to satisfy the maximum ON time
requirement.
[00100] Similarly, in some cases, the user may prefer that the unit's ON time be longer
than, as an example, at least 60 seconds (i.e., minimum ON time), for example to give
the machine sufficient time to emit a discernible amount of fragrance into the
environment. In such a case, applying -45 scent level bias to above example may result
in command data indicating that the unit should operate under a cycle of 30 seconds of
ON time and 570 seconds of OFF time, reflecting in this case increasing the duty cycle
to 95% while keeping the cycle time the same. To satisfy both the desired scent level
bias and the minimum ON time, the command data may then indicate that the unit
should operate under a cycle of 60 seconds of ON time and 1140 seconds of OFF time,
reflecting in this case decreasing the duty cycle time to 5%, as before, but also
simultaneously increasing the cycle time from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds to satisfy
the maximum ON time requirement.
[00101] In some implementations, the user may prefer that the scent delivery unit
operate in accordance with minimum/maximum OFF time. In such cases, the cycle time
may also be similarly varied as described above with respect to minimum/maximum ON
time.
[00102] In another implementation, the central controller 102 can include pre
determined logic to prevent scent delivery units that are "linked" or "related" to each
other from being activated simultaneously. A scent delivery unit, or machine, may be
said to be related (or linked) to another if a user makes a prior determination, for
example, that these two particular machines should not be activated at the same time
regardless of information contained in the scheduled events.

[00103] In an example scenario, a systems administrator may determine that scent
delivery unit A and scent delivery unit B, each of which is configured to deliver a
different scent to a same room, should not be activated at the same time in order to
prevent overscenting the room and exposing its occupants to unpleasantly high levels of
scent. In this case, the systems administrator may indicate to the central controller 102
that units A and B are related to each other. The pull-down box 320 (FIG. 3) may list all
available scent delivery units that the systems administrator may designate as being
related. Once units A and B are designated as being related, the central controller 102
may be configured to prevent conflicting events from proceeding as scheduled. An
example of a conflicting event could be where a first scheduled event indicates that unit
A should be activated every Monday through Wednesday from 9:00am to 5:00pm while
a second scheduled event indicates that unit B, which is related to unit A, should be
activated every Wednesday through Friday from 3:00pm to 10:00pm. In this case, the
two events may be said to be in conflict because an overlapping activation period
occurs on every Wednesday from 3:00pm to 5:00pm.
[00104] In some implementations, in addition to or as an alternative to the system
administrator directly indicating which machines are related, the central controller 102
may automatically identify any units that, for example, share a location as being related.
For example, the central controller 102, upon receiving or otherwise accessing
information that units A and B are both located in the same room, may automatically
determine that units A and B are related to each other. In some implementations, the
system administrator may manually set a preference with the central controller 102 that
instructs the central controller 102 to perform an automatic relatedness determination.
[00105] While the above example discloses an automatic relatedness determination
being performed by the central controller 102 based on determining that two units are
collocated, the automatic relatedness determination performed by the central controller
102 (or the manual determination of the system administrator) may take into account
one or more other factors in addition to or as an alternative to unit collocation. For
example, scent delivery units that emit incompatible scents (e.g., scents that are not
pleasant when smelled at the same time) may be defined or identified as being related.
In another non-limiting example, scent delivery units that share a common power supply
                                              31

     WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
may be defined or identified as being related, for example, to prevent the common
power supply from being overdrawn. In yet another non-limiting example, scent delivery
units that are installed in different locations but otherwise emit scent to a same location
(e.g., via the HVAC system) may be defined or identified as being related. In some
cases, multiple machine-specific factors may need to be considered to indicate
relatedness. For example, two machines may be said to be related if they share the
same location but are configured to emit a different scent, or alternatively the same
scent.
[00106] In another implementation, the central controller 102 may allow a user to
schedule an anti-event in much the same way that a regular scenting event may be
scheduled, with the anti-event capable of having priority over regular events. This may
be desirable, for example, if the user wishes to schedule ahead of time one or more
periods of time during which a particular location within the scenting environment will
not be subjected to any scent delivery. In other words, the user might want to establish
a kind of a "scent exclusion period" for certain scent delivery unit (or units) that may be
associated with a particular location. It may also be desirable to schedule such a scent
exclusion period, which also may be referred to as an anti-event, without having to alter
any of the multiple scheduled events that may happen to address scent delivery
directed to the time and location in question. To this end, the central controller 102 may
be configured to generate command data to create such a scent exclusion period in
accordance with pre-determined logic without having to alter pre-existing, or
subsequently entered, scenting events.
[00107] One difference between an event and an anti-event may be that the event is
configured to schedule a period of activation for a machine while the anti-event is
configured to schedule a period of non-activation. In this way, a user may be able to
use anti-events to quickly and easily schedule ahead a scent exclusion period during
which certain machine or machines should not activate, regardless of other scheduled
events that may indicate otherwise. Check boxes 420, 440 (FIG. 4) may be used for
this purpose. Additionally, if scent exclusion is no longer desired, a user may be able to
revert back to control via the regular scenting events by simply removing the anti-event.
                                                32

      WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
 [00108] In another implementation, each scent delivery unit may be associated with a
fail safe time that indicates a maximum amount of time that a machine will remain on in
the event of, for example, a communication failure that prevents the unit that has turned
on from receiving a turn off signal. As a result, overscenting by any particular machine
due to a lost signal within the network may be prevented. In some cases, the fail safe
time for each machine may be determined by the user through, for example, the fail
safe entry boxes 320 (FIG. 3). Alternatively, or additionally, the fail safe time for each
machine may be determined automatically by the central controller 102 according to a
pre-defined algorithm (e.g., fail safe time is proportional to the size of the room in which
the corresponding scent delivery unit is located).
[00109] As noted above, the central controller 102 is configured to generate and send
command data to control each scent delivery unit. In some cases, the fail safe time for
each machine, defined manually and/or automatically as described above, may be sent
to the machine every time that a turn on command is sent. For example, a command to
turn on a particular machine may be sent along with fail safe time data of 10 minutes. In
turn, the receiving machine may be configured to respond to the fail safe time of 10
minutes by subsequently turning itself off 10 minutes after turning on if no turn off
command is received by that time. That is, if the central controller 102 sends a turn off
signal 1 minute after having sent the turn on signal (e.g., as part of an activation period
that includes multiple cycles of on/off commands) but the turn off signal becomes lost or
is otherwise never received by the machine, the machine will nevertheless turn off
automatically according to the fail safe time at the 10 minute mark if no other turn off
signals are received by then from the central controller 102. If the first turn off signal is
never received by the machine, but a subsequent turn on signal with its own fail safe
data is received before the end of the previous fail safe time period, then the machine
may be configured to turn off automatically according to the new fail safe time. If the
subsequently received turn on signal does not include a new fail safe time, the machine
may revert back to and newly apply the previously received fail safe time. Because the
fail safe time data is sent along with the command data, the fail safe time may be
updated as needed based on user preference and/or machine-specific factors. In some
cases, the fail safe time may be sent periodically to the machine along with just some of
                                               33

      WO 2015/006463                                                     PCT/US2014/045977
the command data sent to said machine. In some cases, the central controller 102 may
be configured to send only turn on signals to each scent delivery unit without sending
any turn off signals. In such a case, the fail safe time may be sent along with each turn
on signal so that each unit will turn off by itself after a desired amount of time without
having to receive an explicit turn off signal from the central controller 102. In such a
case, a turn off signal sent by the central controller 102 may serve as a redundant
process for ensuring that the scent delivery units will not overscent. In some cases, the
fail safe time period may be shorter than the desired on period. In such a case, the
central controller 102 may adjust and/or prompt the user to adjust the fail safe time to be
at least longer than the desired on period.
[00110] In another implementation, the central controller 102 may be configured to
introduce asynchronicity to the start times of multiple scent delivery units that are
scheduled to activate at the same time. As a result, multiple command data that may
otherwise have been transmitted simultaneously to multiple machines may instead be
spread out in time. Such artificially introduced asynchronicity may help prevent
overloading the network and/or reduce power surges that may occur from multiple
machines being commanded to turn on simultaneously.
[00111] In one implementation, the central controller 102 may achieve the desired
asynchronicity by adding a different skew parameter to the start time of each unit
originally scheduled for a synchronous start. For example, given a predefined global
skew parameter G (e.g., 0.1 seconds), the central controller 102 may add a different
multiple of the global skew parameter (e.g., OxG, 1xG, 2xG, 3xG, etc.) to each of
multiple machines that have been scheduled by the user to start scenting at the same
time (e.g., 4:00pm). This way, each of the machines scheduled by the user to activate
at 4:00pm will start at a slightly different time.
[00112] In another implementation, the central controller 102 may be configured to
compensate for unintended asynchronicity in multiple machines that are configured to
behave synchronously, especially under a duty cycle-based control scheme. As noted
above, precise control of scent levels may be achieved by turning each scent delivery
unit on and off successively in accordance with a specified duty cycle during said unit's
time of activation. Under this control scheme, a cycle time of each scenting unit may
                                                34

      WO 2015/006463                                                   PCT/US2014/045977
refer to the period of time during which one on-off cycle occurs for a given machine
while the duty cycle would refer to the percentage of time during each cycle time during
said machine is releasing scent. By synchronizing the start of on-off cycles across
multiple machines, the perception of scent variation within a scenting environment may
be maximized. In other words, if there are multiple machines that are
configured/programmed to be synchronized, the central controller 102 may adjust the
generation and/or transmission of command data to ensure that all on-off cycles for the
three machines occur at the same time. For example, if three machines A, B, and C are
scheduled to activate at 4:00pm based on a cycle time of 10 minutes and a duty cycle
of, respectively, 50%, 40%, and 30%, then the central controller 102 may generate
command data, as discussed above, to turn on machines A, B, and C at 4:00pm and to
subsequently turn off the machines at 4:05pm, 4:04pm, and 4:03pm, respectively.
During the next on-off cycle, the central controller 102 may generate command data to
turn on machines A, B, and C at 4:10pm and to subsequently turn off the machines at
4:15pm, 4:14pm, and 4:13pm, respectively. This cycling process will typically continue
until the scheduled deactivation time, with all three machines starting each cycle at the
same time. In some cases, however, a synchronously scheduled machine may drift
from the synchronized schedule. For example, machine B in the above scenario may
start at a delayed start time of 4:01pm due to a communication error, and this 1 minute
delay may be propagated to each subsequent on times (e.g., 4:11pm, 4:21pm, etc.).
Upon identifying the delay in machine B, under the synchronous start implementation,
the central controller 102 may also delay by 1 minute the start of each cycle for
machines A and C. This way, machines A, B, and C will continue to turn on at the same
time to achieve the desired scenting effect, regardless of any individual machine delays
that may have otherwise broken up the scheduled synchronicity. In one
implementation, the central controller 102 may be configured to identify delays in the
machines by accessing the corresponding verification information in the in table 1012.
