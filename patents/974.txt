                 SYSTEM FOR FACILITATING INTRANASAL GUIDANCE
[0001]   This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No 2014352997
filed 20 November 2014, which is a national phase application of PCT Application No.
PCT/US2014/066597, filed 20 November 2014, that claims priority to United States
Provisional Application No 61/907,328 filed 21 November 2013. The contents of each of
these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]   This invention relates to an apparatus and method for facilitating intranasal guidance.
More particularly, the invention relates an apparatus and method for positioning the tip of a
catheter adjacent to a patient's sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]   U.S. Patent No. 8,388,600, incorporated herein by reference, describes a device and
method of positioning a catheter tip within a patient's nasal cavity in order to deliver an
anesthetic to create a nerve block. As explained in U.S. Patent No. 8,388,600, Fig. 1 depicts a
cutaway view of the anatomical features of a typical human nasal cavity. One skilled in the art
will recognize that certain anatomical features and structures of the human nasal cavity have
been omitted to avoid obscuring the structures relevant to the practice of the current invention.
To help orient the reader, the mouth 106 is illustrated with teeth 108 and tongue 110. The
anatomical structures relevant to the practice of the current invention include the palate 100
which separates the oral cavity 102 from the nasal cavity 104, the inferior sinus turbinate 112,
                                                 1

the middle sinus turbinate 114 and the superior sinus turbinate 116 as well as the nasal bone 122.
The middle sinus turbinate 114 and superior sinus turbinate 116 define the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118. Deep within the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine
recess 118 at the posterior 124 of the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118 lies the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine ganglia 120.
 [0004]     One skilled in the art will recognize that the medical community is not uniform in the
terminology with regard to the sphenopalatine or pterygopalatine ganglia. Certain practitioners
use sphenopalatine while others use pterygopalatine. Therefore, the present description will refer
to the ganglia labeled 120 as the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine ganglia 120. Similarly, the
recess labeled 118 will be referred to as the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118. However,
this terminology is in no way limiting on the structure for which the present invention is
intended. Where practitioners or scientist differentiate between the sphenopalatine ganglia or the
pterygopalatine ganglia, the present disclosure will be understood to apply to either structure.
 [0005]     As is evident from Fig. 1, the structure of the nasal cavity makes it difficult to deliver
a catheter tip to the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118. While U.S. Patent No. 8,388,600
describes a device and method of positioning a catheter tip, such may not be sufficiently accurate
and/or may be complicated in use.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0006]     In at least one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus, system, and method
for facilitating intranasal fluoroscopic guidance, visualization, administration of radiopaque
substances, fluids, and medication to a patients nasal sinus including the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess. The apparatus includes a wire in which the internal
                                                    2

catheter tracks over the wire into the desired location, and a catheter having a lumen disposed
therethrough, the catheter comprising an intrinsic curvature, soft straight proximal end, or a
shape memory curvature with respect to a longitudinal axis of the catheter such that the insertion
end of the catheter lies in a first plane and the manipulation end of the catheter lies in a second
plane, wherein the catheter smoothly transitions between the wire, the first plane and the second
plane, the intrinsic curvature conforming to the wire and the patients nasal anatomy such that the
catheter may be inserted into a sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess. The external catheter
assists the delivery of the catheter by adding stability and pushability to the overall system
allowing the internal catheter to be softer and more comfortable to the patient.
[0007]      In another aspect, the invention provides a sphenocath including a sheath assembly
including a sheath hub with a sheath tube extending therefrom with a passage extending from a
proximal end of the sheath hub to a distal end of the sheath tube; a catheter assembly including a
catheter hub with a catheter tube extending therefrom with a passage extending from a proximal
end of the catheter hub to a distal end of the catheter tube; wherein the catheter assembly passes
through the sheath assembly with a portion of the catheter hub engaging a portion of the sheath
hub to limit relative rotation between the hubs while permitting relative axial movement such
that in an initial non-extended position the distal end of the catheter tube is proximate to the
distal end of the sheath tube. A system further including a guidewire is also provided.
[0008]      In yet another aspect, the invention provides a system including a sphenocath
configured to be positioned over and guide into position by a guidewire.
                                                   3

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0031]      In the drawings, like numerals indicate like elements throughout. Certain terminology
is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a limitation on the present
invention. The following describes preferred embodiments of the present invention. However, it
should be understood, based on this disclosure, that the invention is not limited by the preferred
embodiments described herein.
[0032]      Referring to Figs. 2-12, a sphenocath 300 in accordance with an exemplary
embodiment of the invention will be described. The sphenocath 300 generally comprises a
catheter assembly 310 and a sheath assembly 340. As explained in more detail below, the
catheter assembly 310 is configured to be positioned within the sheath assembly 340 and to be
moved between an initial, non-extended position as illustrated in Fig. 2 and an extended position
as illustrated in Fig. 10.
                                                     5

[0033]     Referring to Figs. 4-6, the exemplary catheter assembly 310 generally includes a
catheter tube 330 extending from a catheter hub 312. The catheter hub 312 has a generally
cylindrical body 314 extending between a proximal end 311 and a distal end 313. A through
passage 316 extends through the body 314 from the proximal end 311 to the distal end 313. The
proximal end of the passage 316 may have a larger opening 315 which then tapers at 317 to the
diameter of the lumen 332 of the catheter tube 330. The proximal end 311 of the catheter hub
312 preferably includes a thread 308 or the like for connection of the catheter assembly 310 to a
syringe or the like (not shown). The distal end 313 of the catheter hub 312 includes a radial
projection 322 configured to guide motion relative to the sheath hub 342 as described
hereinafter. The radial projection 322 includes a proximal shoulder 321 and a distal tapered
surface 323 which facilitates passage of the catheter hub 312 into the sheath hub 342. The
projection 322 has a width w as illustrated in Fig. 6.
[0034]     Between the ends 311, 313, the catheter hub 312 includes one or more annular rings
318 which define a gripping structure of the catheter hub 312. A distal most ring 318 defines a
stop 319 which limits the amount of distal movement of the catheter hub 312 relative to the
sheath hub 342. The catheter hub 312 is preferably manufactured from a generally rigid
material, for example, a polymer such as Isoplast@ 2510.
[0035]     The catheter tube 330 extends from a proximal end 331 secured within the hub
passage 316 to a free distal end 333. The catheter tube 330 is manufactured from a flexible
material, for example, a polyurethane elastomer such as Pellethane®. The catheter tube 330
defines a hollow lumen 332 extending from the proximal end 331 to the distal end 333 such that
a continuous passage is defined by the catheter hub passage 316 and the lumen 332. Referring to
Figs. 10-12, the distal end 333 of the catheter tube 330 may be formed with a preformed
                                                  6

curvature 335. The curvature 335 is such that an axis DA of the distal end 333 is at an angle
relative to the axis PA of the proximal end 331. The angle is preferably between 300 to 90' and
more preferably is between 350 to 55'. The angle is preferably chosen to correspond to the
anatomy of the patient's nasal cavity.
[0036]      Referring to Figs. 7-9, the exemplary sheath assembly 340 will be described. The
sheath assembly 340 generally includes a sheath tube 360 extending from a sheath hub 342. The
sheath hub 342 has a generally tubular body 344 extending between a proximal end 341 and a
distal end 343. A through passage 345 extends through the body 344 from the proximal end 341
to the distal end 343. The proximal end of the passage 345 may have a larger opening 349 while
the distal end 343 has a smaller passage 347 which approximates the diameter of the lumen 362
of the sheath tube 360. The proximal end 341 of the catheter hub 342 preferably includes an
annular shoulder 354 about the opening 349 which defines an internal shoulder 356.
[0037]      A guide slot 346 extends along the top surface of the sheath hub body 344 from the
shoulder 356 to the distal end 343. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the guide slot 346 has a width W
which is slightly larger than the width w of the catheter hub projection 322. As illustrated in
Figs. 11 and 12, the distal end of the catheter hub 312 is received in the passage 345 such that the
projection 322 moves within the guide slot 346. Referring to Fig. 14, contact of the projection
proximal shoulder 321 with the internal shoulder 356 limits proximal movement of the catheter
hub 312 relative to the sheath hub 342.
[0038]      Positioning of the projection 322 in the guide slot 346 also controls the relative
rotational movement between the hubs 312 and 342. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the larger width W
of the guide slot 346 compared to the width w of the projection 322 allows for slight rotation of
the catheter tube distal end 333 over a limited range, for example, approximately 10' in each
                                                   7

direction. In this way, the orientation of the preformed curvature 335 of the catheter tube distal
end 333 cannot be modified relative to the sheath hub 342 beyond the controlled range.
[0039]      Referring again to Figs. 7-9, an indicator member 350 with an arrow head 352 covers
a portion of the guide slot 346, preferably at least over the range of axial movement of the
projection 322 within the slot 346. The indicator member 350 provides an indication of the
orientation of the device 300 and more specifically the orientation of the preformed curvature
335. Since, as explained above, the engagement of the projection 322 in the guide slot 346 limits
relative rotation between the hubs 312, 342, the preformed curvature 335 will always be away
from the indicator member 350. As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 9, the indicator member 350 may
be formed with a curvature that mimics the preformed curvature 335, i.e. away from a user
looking from above and proximally of the sheath hub 342.
[0040]      The sheath tube 360 extends from a proximal end 361 secured to the sheath hub 342 to
a free distal end 363. The sheath tube 360 defines a hollow lumen 362 extending from the
proximal end 361 to the distal end 363 such that a continuous passage is defined by the sheath
hub passage 345 and the lumen 362. The distal end 363 of the sheath tube 360 preferably has a
tapered portion 364 which provides a tapered contact surface during advancement of the sheath
tube 360 and also conforms the sheath tube diameter to that of the catheter tube 330 outer
diameter. The outer surface of the sheath tube 360, preferably on the top surface, has a plurality
of markers 366 which are spaced a given distance from one another. The markers 366 can be
used to illustrate a depth of insertion of the device, for example, the defined depth being a depth
equaling a distance between an entrance to a patient's sphenopalatine recess and an external
entrance to the patient's nostril or a depth relative to a guidewire 370 over which the sphenocath
300 is guided as will be described hereinafter. The sheath tube 360 may also include a
                                                    8

radiopaque mark 665 adjacent to the distal end 363 to assist with placement of the sphenocath
300 utilizing x-ray or fluoroscopy.
[0041]      The sheath tube 360 is manufactured from a semi-flexible material that is more rigid
than the catheter tube 330, but may still have some flexibility. In this way, the sheath tube 360
maintains the preformed curvature 335 straight while within the sheath tube 360. The sheath
tube 360 may also be manufactured from, for example, a polyurethane elastomer such as
Pellethane@, however, it will be a composition that provides the greater rigidity. The sheath
tube 360 may be formed with a lubricant blended with the material thereof or may be coated with
a lubricant such that the sheath tube 360 has an external lubricious surface that minimizes the
need for additional lubricants that may irritate the tracked area.
[0042]      Referring to Fig. 13, the system further includes a guidewire 370 over which the
sphenocath 300 is guided. The guidewire 370 extends from a proximal end 374 to a distal end
372. The distal end 372 may be formed with a preformed curvature 376 which approximates the
preformed curvature 335 of the catheter tube 330, however, it is understood that the curvatures
may be different.
[0043]      Having described the components of an exemplary system, an exemplary method of
insertion of the catheter tube 330 into a patient's nasal cavity will be described with reference to
Figs. 13-15. First, the distal end 372 of the guidewire 370 is inserted into the nostril 202 as
illustrated in Fig. 13. Such insertion may be done, for example, using fluoroscopic guidance or
by physician feel into the sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess or targeted location to access.
[0044]      Referring to Fig. 14, the proximal end 374 of the guidewire 370 is received into the
catheter tube distal end 333 and the sphenocath 300 is advanced over the guidewire 370 as
indicated by arrow A. It is noted that at this stage, the catheter hub 312 is in the initial, non
                                                   9

extended position and the distal end 333 of the catheter tube 330 is proximate to the distal end
363 of the sheath tube 360. The sphenocath 300 is advanced over the guidewire 370 to the
desired position and location, for example, with the distal end 363 of the sheath tube 360
proximate the anterior ridge 204 of the middle sinus turbinate 114. As explained above, the
markings 366 may be utilized to help with the depth of insertion and the radiopaque mark 665
may further assist with placement.
[0045]     Referring to Fig. 15, the catheter hub 312 is then advanced distally relative to the
sheath hub 342 as indicated by arrow B. As such, the distal end 333 of the catheter tube 330 is
extended out of the distal end 363 of the sheath tube 360. The catheter tube distal end 333
follows the path defined by the guidewire distal end 372 as indicated by arrow C. The catheter
distal end 333 is advanced into the patient's sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118 of the
patient or another desired position.
[0046]     Once the catheter distal end 333 is positioned, the guidewire 370 is removed and the
catheter assembly 310 is ready for the desired application, with a passage defined from the hub
passage 316 and through the lumen 332. For example, a syringe or the like (not shown) may be
connected to the thread 308 and a fluid, for example, contrast media, or medication, may be
dispensed to the patient's sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine ganglion 120 disposed within the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess 118.
[0047]     Referring to Figs. 16 and 17, the configuration of an exemplary catheter 310 distal end
333' will be described. The distal end 333' has a substantially closed end 336 except for a
slotted passage 337 extending across the closed end 336. The slotted passage 337 will cause
fluid expelled from the catheter 310 to fan out and provide a spraying or "painting" of the entire
target area. Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate another spraying tip wherein the catheter distal end 333"
                                                  10

has a similar slotted passage 337, however, the closed end 336" tapers to the passage 337, rather
than the rounded end in the previous embodiment. In both embodiments, the slotted passage 337
preferably extends horizontally relative to the angle of the catheter distal end 333. Figs. 20 and
21 illustrate another spraying tip wherein the catheter distal end 333"' has a substantially closed
end 336 except for a series of small openings 338. The openings 338 will again cause fluid
expelled from the catheter 310 to fan out provide a spraying or "painting" of the entire target
area. While five openings 338 are illustrated, more or fewer openings may be provided and may
be arranged in configurations other than the illustrated configuration.
[0048]      These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled
in the art from the foregoing specification. Accordingly, it will be recognized by those skilled in
the art that changes or modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without
departing from the broad inventive concepts of the invention. It should therefore be understood
that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is intended
to include all changes and modifications that are within the scope and spirit of the invention as
defined in the claims.

11.      A method for visualization and/or administration of medication of and into the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess of a patient, the method comprising:
         inserting a guidewire into a nostril of a patient to a target area proximate the
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine recess of the patient;
         providing a sphenocath including a sheath assembly having a sheath hub with a sheath
tube extending therefrom with a passage extending from a proximal end of the sheath hub to
a distal end of the sheath tube, said sheath hub including a guide slot extending along a top
surface thereof; a catheter assembly including a catheter hub with a catheter tube extending
therefrom, a distal end of said catheter tube having a preformed curvature, the catheter tube
having a passage extending from a proximal end of the catheter hub to a distal end of the
catheter tube, said catheter hub including a radially extending projection thereon, wherein the
catheter assembly is configured to pass through the sheath assembly such that the radially
extending projection on the catheter hub engages the guide slot to limit relative rotation
between the hubs over a limited rotational range, wherein the limited rotational range extends
approximately 10 degrees in each rotational direction such that the catheter tube distal end
cannot be modified relative to the sheath hub beyond the limited range while permitting
relative axial movement such that in an initial non-extended position the distal end of the
catheter tube is proximate to the distal end of the sheath tube, wherein said guide slot has a
width larger than a width of the projection such that the catheter hub is configured to rotate
relative to the sheath hub over the limited rotational range;
         advancing the sphenocath over the guidewire and rotating the catheter hub relative to
the sheath hub to conform to an anatomy of the patient's sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine
recess, such that the distal end of the catheter tube is proximal to the target area;
                                                  14

         advancing the catheter assembly relative to the sheath assembly whereby the catheter
tube distal end extends from the sheath tube distal end and bends along the guidewire;
         visually confirming a direction of the preformed curvature and aligning the preformed
curvature of the catheter tube distal end with the patient's sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine
recess;
                 removing the guidewire; and
                 dispensing contrast media, fluids, and/or medication to a
sphenopalatine/pterygopalatine ganglion disposed within the sphenopalatine recess of the
patient.
12.      The method of claim 11, wherein said contrast media, fluids, or medication is
delivered over a middle sinus turbinate of the patient to achieve sphenopalatine ganglion
blockade.
13.      The method of claim 12, wherein sympathetic nerves of the patient are impacted by
accessing the sphenopalatine recess at a back of a sinus cavity extending from a top of the
middle sinus turbinate.
14.      The method of claim 11, wherein the sphenopalatine ganglion blockade is not
achieved by saturation of different areas within a sinus cavity or a throat of the patient.
15.      The method of any one of claims 11, wherein transnasal sphenopalatine visualization
is achieved by delivery of contrast media over a middle sinus turbinate of the patient.
                                                 15

16.     The method of any one of claims 11 to 15, wherein the sheath tube distal end includes
a radiopaque mark and the step of advancing the sphenocath over the guidewire includes the
use of x-ray or fluoroscopy.
17.     The method of any one of claims 11 to 16, wherein the sheath tube includes a series of
distance markings and the step of advancing the sphenocath over the guidewire includes
advancement based on, at least in part, the distance markings.
