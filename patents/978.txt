                TITLE: METHOD AND SYSTEMS FOR THE DELIVERY OF OXYGEN
                                            ENRICHED GAS
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5 1.      Field of the Invention
           The present invention relates generally to methods and system that provide oxygen
   enriched gas to a subject.
   2.      Description of the Related Art
           There are many patients that require supplemental oxygen as part of Long Term Oxygen
10 Therapy (LTOT). Currently, the vast majority of patients that are receiving LTOT are diagnosed
   under the general category of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD.              This general
   diagnosis includes such common diseases as Chronic Asthma, Emphysema, Congestive Heart
   Failure and several other cardio-pulmonary conditions.      Other people (e.g., obese individuals)
   may also require supplemental oxygen, for example, to maintain elevated activity levels.
15
           Doctors may prescribe oxygen concentrators or portable tanks of medical oxygen for
   these patients. Usually a specific oxygen flow rate is prescribed (e.g., 1 liter per minute (LPM), 2
   LPM, 3 LPM, etc.). Experts in this field have also recognized that exercise for these patients
   provide long term benefits that slow the progression of the disease, improve quality of life and
20 extend patient longevity. Most stationary forms of exercise like tread mills and stationary
   bicycles, however, are too strenuous for these patients. As a result, the need for mobility has
   long been recognized.      Until recently, this mobility has been facilitated by the use of small
   compressed oxygen tanks. The disadvantage of these tanks is that they have a finite amount of
   oxygen and they are heavy, weighing about 50 pounds, when mounted on a cart with dolly
25 wheels.
           Oxygen concentrators have been in use for about 50 years to supply patients suffering
   from respiratory insufficiency with supplemental oxygen. Traditional oxygen concentrators used
   to provide these flow rates have been bulky and heavy making ordinary ambulatory activities
   with them difficult and impractical. Recently, companies that manufacture large stationary home
30 oxygen concentrators began developing portable oxygen concentrators, POCs. The advantage of
   POCs concentrators was that they can produce a theoretically endless supply of oxygen. In order
   to make these devices small for mobility, the various systems necessary for the production of
   oxygen enriched gas are condensed.

                                              SUMMARY
           Systems and methods of providing an oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen
   concentrator are described herein.
           In one embodiment, a method of providing oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen
 5 concentrator, includes: measuring the time between at least three successive breaths, wherein a
   breath is determined to begin when a drop in pressure is measured using a pressure sensor
   coupled to an outlet of a conduit coupling the user to an oxygen enriched gas source; determining
   an average breathing rate based on the time between each of the successive breaths, wherein the
   time between the penultimate breath and the last breath is not used to determine the average
10 breathing rate; and setting an inspiration breath pressure threshold for the pressure sensor based
   on the determined average breathing rate. In an embodiment, the time is measured between six
   successive breaths.   Adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold based on the average
   breathing rate, in some embodiments, is performed automatically.         The oxygen enriched gas
   source may be an oxygen concentrator system or an oxygen tank.
15         In some embodiments, the threshold inspiration pressure is lowered when the determined
   average breathing rate changes from greater than 10 breaths per minute to less than 10 breaths
   per minute.    In some embodiments, the threshold inspiration pressure is increased when the
   determined average breathing rate changes from less than 15 breaths per minute to greater than
   15 breaths per minute. The inspiration breath pressure threshold may be maintained at a current
20 setting when the average breathing rate is between about 10 breaths per minute and about 15
   breaths per minute.
           In some embodiments, the method further includes switching to an active mode, a
   sedentary mode, or remaining at the current mode based on the average breathing rate.          For
   example, an active mode may be implemented when the average breathing rate comprises at least
25 15 breaths per minute.    A sedentary mode may be activated when the average breathing rate
   comprises less than 10 breaths per minute.
           In an embodiment, an oxygen concentrator apparatus includes: a pressure sensor, the
   pressure sensor configured to detect a breath pressure of a user; and a processor operable coupled
   to the pressure sensor.      The processor is capable      of executing non-transitory program
30 instructions, wherein the program instructions are operable to: automatically measure the time
   between at least three successive breaths, wherein a breath is determined to begin when a drop in
   pressure is measured using the pressure sensor; determine an average breathing rate or an average
   time between breaths, based on the time between each of the successive breaths, wherein the time
   between the penultimate breath and the last breath is not used to determine the average breathing
                                                  Page 2

   rate or an average time between breaths; and set an inspiration breath pressure threshold for the
   pressure sensor based on the determined average breathing rate or an average time between
   breaths.
            In another embodiment, a method of providing oxygen enriched gas to a user of an
 5 oxygen concentrator includes: determining a ratio of the change in absolute pressure during
   inhalation with respect to time, monitored over at least three breaths, wherein inhalation is
   determined to begin when a drop in pressure is measured using a pressure sensor coupled to an
   outlet of a conduit coupling the user to an oxygen enriched gas source; and adjusting an
   inspiration breath pressure threshold of the breath pressure sensor based on the ratio of the
10 change in absolute pressure with respect to time.          When determining the ratio, in some
   embodiments, the change in absolute pressure of the last breath is not used to determine the ratio.
   The oxygen enriched gas source may be an oxygen concentrator system or an oxygen tank.
           Adjusting an inspiration breath pressure threshold of the pressure sensor based on the
   ratio includes adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a lower inspiration threshold
15 breath pressure relative to a current inspiration breath pressure threshold if the ratio is negative.
   In an embodiment, adjusting an inspiration breath pressure threshold of the pressure sensor based
   on the ratio includes adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a lower inspiration
   threshold breath pressure relative to a current inspiration breath pressure threshold if the ratio is
   negative and less than or equal to -0.5.
20         Adjusting an inspiration breath pressure threshold of the pressure sensor based on the
   ratio includes adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a higher inspiration threshold
   breath pressure relative to a current inspiration breath pressure threshold if the ratio is positive.
   In an embodiment, adjusting an inspiration breath pressure threshold of the pressure sensor based
   on the ratio includes adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a higher inspiration
25 threshold breath pressure relative to a current inspiration breath pressure threshold if the ratio is
   positive and greater than or equal to -0.5.
            In some embodiments, the method further includes switching to an active mode, a
   sedentary mode, or remaining at the current mode based on the average breathing rate. For
   example, an active mode may be implemented when the ratio is positive. A sedentary mode may
30 be activated when the ratio is negative.
            In an embodiment, an oxygen concentrator apparatus includes: a pressure sensor
   configured to detect a breath pressure of a user; and a processor coupled to the pressure sensor.
   The processor is capable of executing non-transitory program instructions, wherein the program
   instructions are operable to: determine of a ratio of the change in absolute pressure during
                                                   Page 3

   inhalation with respect to time, monitored over at least three breaths, wherein inhalation is
   determined to begin when a drop in pressure is measured using a pressure sensor coupled to an
   outlet of a conduit coupling the user to an oxygen enriched gas source; and adjust an inspiration
   breath pressure threshold of the breath pressure sensor based on the ratio of the change in
 5 absolute pressure with respect to time.
           In an embodiment, a method of providing oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen
   concentrator, includes: measuring the time between a plurality of successive breaths, wherein a
   breath is determined to begin when a drop in pressure is measured using a pressure sensor
   coupled to an outlet of a conduit coupling the user to an oxygen enriched gas source; creating
10 groupings of breaths, wherein each grouping comprises at least three successive breaths;
   determining an average breathing rate for each grouping based on the time between each of the
   successive breaths within the grouping; and setting an inspiration breath pressure threshold for
   the pressure sensor based on the determined average breathing rate of two or more of the
   groupings.

10                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           It is to be understood the present invention is not limited to particular devices or methods,
   which may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the
   purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. Headings
   are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit or interpret the
15 description or claims. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms
    a   "an", and "the" include singular and plural referents unless the content clearly dictates
   otherwise. Furthermore, the word "may" is used throughout this application in a permissive
   sense (i.e., having the potential to, being able to), not in a mandatory sense (i.e., must). The term
   "include," and derivations thereof, mean "including, but not limited to."
20         The term "coupled" as used herein means either a direct connection or an indirect
   connection (e.g., one or more intervening connections) between one or more objects or
   components. The phrase "connected" means a direct connection between objects or components
   such that the objects or components are connected directly to each other. As used herein the
   phrase "obtaining" a device means that the device is either purchased or constructed.
25         Oxygen concentrators take advantage of pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Pressure
   swing adsorption involves using a compressor to increase gas pressure inside a canister that
   contains particles of a gas separation adsorbent. As the pressure increases, certain molecules in
   the gas may become adsorbed onto the gas separation adsorbent. Removal of a portion of the gas
   in the canister under the pressurized conditions allows separation of the non-adsorbed molecules
30 from the adsorbed molecules. The gas separation adsorbent may be regenerated by reducing the
   pressure, which reverses the adsorption of molecules from the adsorbent. Further details
   regarding oxygen concentrators may be found, for example, in U.S. Published Patent Application
   No. 2009-0065007, published March 12, 2009, and entitled "Oxygen Concentrator Apparatus
   and Method", which is incorporated herein by reference.

           Ambient air usually includes approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with the
   balance comprised of argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor and other trace elements.            If a gas
   mixture such as air, for example, is passed under pressure through a vessel containing a gas
   separation adsorbent bed that attracts nitrogen more strongly than it does oxygen, part or all of
 5 the nitrogen will stay in the bed, and the gas coming out of the vessel will be enriched in oxygen.
   When the bed reaches the end of its capacity to adsorb nitrogen, it can be regenerated by
   reducing the pressure, thereby releasing the adsorbed nitrogen. It is then ready for another cycle
   of producing oxygen enriched air. By alternating canisters in a two-canister system, one canister
   can be collecting oxygen while the other canister is being purged (resulting in a continuous
10 separation of the oxygen from the nitrogen). In this manner, oxygen can be accumulated out of
   the air for a variety of uses include providing supplemental oxygen to patients.
            FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of an oxygen concentrator 100, according to an
   embodiment. Oxygen concentrator 100 may concentrate oxygen out of an air stream to provide
   oxygen enriched gas to a user. As used herein, "oxygen enriched gas" is composed of at least
15 about 50% oxygen, at least about 60% oxygen, at least about 70% oxygen, at least about 80%
   oxygen, at least about 90% oxygen, at least about 95% oxygen, at least about 98% oxygen, or at
   least about 99% oxygen.
            Oxygen concentrator 100 may be a portable oxygen concentrator.         For example, oxygen
   concentrator 100 may have a weight and size that allows the oxygen concentrator to be carried by
20 hand and/or in a carrying case. In one embodiment, oxygen concentrator 100 has a weight of less
   than about 20 lbs., less than about 15 lbs., less than about 10 lbs., or less than about 5 lbs. In an
   embodiment, oxygen concentrator 100 has a volume of less than about 1000 cubic inches, less
   than about 750 cubic inches; less than about 500 cubic inches, less than about 250 cubic inches,
   or less than about 200 cubic inches.
25          Oxygen may be collected from ambient air by pressurizing ambient air in canisters 302
   and 304, which include a gas separation adsorbent. Gas separation adsorbents useful in an
   oxygen concentrator are capable of separating at least nitrogen from an air stream to produce
   oxygen enriched gas. Examples of gas separation adsorbents include molecular sieves that are
   capable of separation of nitrogen from an air stream. Examples of adsorbents that may be used in
30 an oxygen concentrator include, but are not limited to, zeolites (natural) or synthetic crystalline
   aluminosilicates that separate nitrogen from oxygen in an air stream under elevated pressure.
   Examples of synthetic crystalline aluminosilicates that may be used include, but are not limited
   to: OXYSIV adsorbents available from UOP LLC, Des Plaines, IW; SYLOBEAD adsorbents
   available from W. R. Grace & Co, Columbia, MD; SILIPORITE adsorbents available from
                                                   Page 6

   Switzerland; and AgLiLSX adsorbent available from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
   Allentown, PA.
           As shown in FIG. 1, air may enter the oxygen concentrator through air inlet 106. Air may
 5 be drawn into air inlet 106 by compression system 200. Compression system 200 may draw in
   air from the surroundings of the oxygen concentrator and compress the air, forcing the
   compressed air into one or both canisters 302 and 304. In an embodiment, an inlet muffler 108
   may be coupled to air inlet 106 to reduce sound produced by air being pulled into the oxygen
   generator by compression system 200. In an embodiment, inlet muffler 108 may be a moisture
10 and sound absorbing muffler. For example, a water absorbent material (such as a polymer water
   absorbent material or a zeolite material) may be used to both absorb water from the incoming air
   and to reduce the sound of the air passing into the air inlet 106.
           Compression system 200 may include one or more compressors capable of compressing
   air. In some embodiments, compression system may include one, two, three, four, or more
15 compressors. Compression system 200 as depicted that includes compressor 210 and motor 220.
   Motor 220 is coupled to compressor 210 and provides an operating force to the compressor to
   operate the compression mechanism. Pressurized air, produced by compression system 200, may
   be forced into one or both of the canisters 302 and 304. In some embodiments, the ambient air
   may be pressurized in the canisters to a pressure approximately in a range of 13-20 pounds per
20 square inch (psi). Other pressures may also be used, depending on the type of gas separation
   adsorbent disposed in the canisters.
           In some embodiments, motor 220 is coupled to a pressurizing device (e.g. piston pump or
   a diaphragm pump). The pressuring device may be a piston pump that has multiple pistons.
   During operation, the pistons may be selectively turned on or off. In some embodiments, motor
25 220 may be coupled to multiple pumps. Each pump may be selectively turned on or off. For
   example, controller 400 may determine which pumps or pistons should be operated based on
   predetermined operating conditions.
           Coupled to each canister 302/304 are inlet valves 122/124 and outlet valves 132/134. As
   shown in FIG. 1, inlet valve 122 is coupled to canister 302 and inlet valve 124 is coupled to
30 canister 304. Outlet valve 132 is coupled to canister 302 and outlet valve 134 is coupled to
   canister 304.   Inlet valves 122/124 are used to control the passage of air from compression
   system 200 to the respective canisters. Outlet valves 132/134 are used to release gas from the
   respective canisters during a venting process. In some embodiments, inlet valves 122/124 and
   outlet valves 132/134 may be silicon plunger solenoid valves. Other types of valves, however,
                                                  Page 7

   may be used. Plunger valves offer advantages over other kinds of valves by being quiet and
   having low slippage.
           In some embodiments, a two-step valve actuation voltage may be used to control inlet
   valves 122/124 and outlet valves 132/134. For example, a high voltage (e.g., 24 V) may be
 5 applied to an inlet valve to open the inlet valve. The voltage may then be reduced (e.g., to 7 V)
   to keep the inlet valve open. Using less voltage to keep a valve open may use less power (Power
   = Voltage * Current). This reduction in voltage minimizes heat buildup and power consumption
   to extend run time from the battery. When the power is cut off to the valve, it closes by spring
   action. In some embodiments, the voltage may be applied as a function of time that is not
10 necessarily a stepped response (e.g., a curved downward voltage between an initial 24 V and a
   final 7 V).
           In some embodiments, air may be pulled into the oxygen concentrator through
   compressors 305, 310.      In some embodiments, air may flow from compressors 305, 310 to
   canisters 302, 304. In some embodiments, one of valves 122 or 124 may be closed (e.g., as
15 signaled by controller 400) resulting in the combined output of both compressors 305, 310
   lowing through the other respective valve 122 or 124 into a respective canister 302, 304. For
   example, if valve 124 is closed, the air from both compressors 305, 310 may flow through valve
   122. If valve 122 is closed, the air from both compressors 305, 310 may flow through valve 124.
   In some embodiments, valve 122 and valve 124 may alternate to alternately direct the air from
20 the compressors 305, 310 into respective canisters 302 or 304.
           In an embodiment, pressurized air is sent into one of canisters 302 or 304 while the other
   canister is being vented. For example, during use, inlet valve 122 is opened while inlet valve 124
   is closed. Pressurized air from compression system 200 is forced into canister 302, while being
   inhibited from entering canister 304 by inlet valve 124. In an embodiment, a controller 400 is
25 electrically coupled to valves 122, 124, 132, and 134.      Controller 400 includes one or more
   processors 410 operable to execute program instructions stored in memory 420. The program
   instructions are operable to perform various predefined methods that are used to operate the
   oxygen concentrator. Controller 400 may include program instructions for operating inlet valves
   122 and 124 out of phase with each other, i.e., when one of inlet valves 122 or 124 is opened, the
30 other valve is closed. During pressurization of canister 302, outlet valve 132 is closed and outlet
   valve 134 is opened. Similar to the inlet valves, outlet valves 132 and 134 are operated out of
   phase with each other. In some embodiments, the voltages and the duration of the voltages used
   to open the input and output valves may be controlled by controller 400.

           Check valves 142 and 144 are coupled to canisters 302 and 304, respectively. Check
   valves 142 and 144 are one way valves that are passively operated by the pressure differentials
   that occur as the canisters are pressurized and vented. Check valves 142 and 144 are coupled to
   canisters to allow oxygen produced during pressurization of the canister to flow out of the
 5 canister, and to inhibit back flow of oxygen or any other gases into the canister. In this manner,
   check valves 142 and 144 act as one way valves allowing oxygen enriched gas to exit the
   respective canister during pressurization.
           The term "check valve", as used herein, refers to a valve that allows flow of a fluid (gas
   or liquid) in one direction and inhibits back flow of the fluid. Examples of check valves that are
10 suitable for use include, but are not limited to: a ball check valve; a diaphragm check valve; a
   butterfly check valve; a swing check valve; a duckbill valve; and a lift check valve. Under
   pressure, nitrogen molecules in the pressurized ambient air are adsorbed by the gas separation
   adsorbent in the pressurized canister. As the pressure increases, more nitrogen is adsorbed until
   the gas in the canister is enriched in oxygen. The nonadsorbed gas molecules (mainly oxygen)
15 flow out of the pressurized canister when the pressure reaches a point sufficient to overcome the
   resistance of the check valve coupled to the canister. In one embodiment, the pressure drop of
   the check valve in the forward direction is less than 1 psi. The break pressure in the reverse
   direction is greater than 100 psi. It should be understood, however, that modification of one or
   more components would alter the operating parameters of these valves.          If the forward flow
20 pressure is increased, there is, generally, a reduction in oxygen enriched gas production. If the
   break pressure for reverse flow is reduced or set too low, there is, generally, a reduction in
   oxygen enriched gas pressure.
           In an exemplary embodiment, canister 302 is pressurized by compressed air produced in
   compression system 200 and passed into canister 302. During pressurization of canister 302 inlet
25 valve 122 is open, outlet valve 132 is closed, inlet valve 124 is closed and outlet valve 134 is
   open.    Outlet valve 134 is opened when outlet valve 132 is closed to allow substantially
   simultaneous venting of canister 304 while canister 302 is pressurized.            Canister 302 is
   pressurized until the pressure in canister is sufficient to open check valve 142. Oxygen enriched
   gas produced in canister 302 exits through check valve and, in one embodiment, is collected in
30 accumulator 106.
           After some time the gas separation adsorbent will become saturated with nitrogen and
   will be unable to separate significant amounts of nitrogen from incoming air. This point is
   usually reached after a predetermined time of oxygen enriched gas production.               In the
   embodiment described above, when the gas separation adsorbent in canister 302 reaches this
                                                   Page 9

   saturation point, the inflow of compressed air is stopped and canister 302 is vented to remove
   nitrogen. During venting, inlet valve 122 is closed, and outlet valve 132 is opened. While
   canister 302 is being vented, canister 304 is pressurized to produce oxygen enriched gas in the
   same manner described above. Pressurization of canister 304 is achieved by closing outlet valve
 5 134 and opening inlet valve 124. The oxygen enriched gas exits canister 304 through check
   valve 144.
            During venting of canister 302, outlet valve 132 is opened allowing pressurized gas
   (mainly nitrogen) to exit the canister through concentrator outlet 130. In an embodiment, the
   vented gases may be directed through muffler 133 to reduce the noise produced by releasing the
10 pressurized gas from the canister. As gas is released from canister 302, pressure in the canister
   drops. The drop in pressure may allow the nitrogen to become desorbed from the gas separation
   adsorbent. The released nitrogen exits the canister through outlet 130, resetting the canister to a
   state that allows renewed separation of oxygen from an air stream. Muffler 133 may include
   open cell foam (or another material) to muffle the sound of the gas leaving the oxygen
15 concentrator. In some embodiments, the combined muffling components/techniques for the input
   of air and the output of gas may provide for oxygen concentrator operation at a sound level
   below 50 decibels.
            During venting of the canisters, it is advantageous that at least a majority of the nitrogen
   is removed. In an embodiment, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at
20 least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, or substantially all of
   the nitrogen in a canister is removed before the canister is re-used to separate oxygen from air.
   In some embodiments, a canister may be further purged of nitrogen using an oxygen enriched
   stream that is introduced into the canister from the other canister.
            In an exemplary embodiment, a portion of the oxygen enriched gas may be transferred
25 from canister 302 to canister 304 when canister 304 is being vented of nitrogen. Transfer of
   oxygen enriched gas from canister 302 to 304, during venting of canister 304, helps to further
   purge nitrogen (and other gases) from the canister. In an embodiment, oxygen enriched gas may
   travel through flow restrictors 151, 153, and 155 between the two canisters. Flow restrictor 151
   may be a trickle flow restrictor.       Flow restrictor 151, for example, may be a 0.009D flow
30 restrictor (e.g., the flow restrictor has a radius of 0.009 inches which is less than the diameter of
   the tube it is inside). Flow restrictors 153 and 155 may be 0.013D flow restrictors. Other flow
   restrictor types and sizes are also contemplated and may be used depending on the specific
   configuration and tubing used to couple the canisters. In some embodiments, the flow restrictors
   may be press fit flow restrictors that restrict air flow by introducing a narrower diameter in their
                                                    Page 10

   respective tube. In some embodiments, the press fit flow restrictors may be made of sapphire,
   metal or plastic (other materials are also contemplated).
            Flow of oxygen enriched gas is also controlled by use of valve 152 and valve 154.
   Valves 152 and 154 may be opened for a short duration during the venting process (and may be
 5 closed otherwise) to prevent excessive oxygen loss out of the purging canister. Other durations
   are also contemplated. In an exemplary embodiment, canister 302 is being vented and it is
   desirable to purge canister 302 by passing a portion of the oxygen enriched gas being produced in
   canister 304 into canister 302. A portion of oxygen enriched gas, upon pressurization of canister
   304, will pass through flow restrictor 151 into canister 302 during venting of canister 302.
10 Additional oxygen enriched air is passed into canister 302, from canister 304, through valve 154
   and flow restrictor 155. Valve 152 may remain closed during the transfer process, or may be
   opened if additional oxygen enriched gas is needed. The selection of appropriate flow restrictors
   151 and 155, coupled with controlled opening of valve 154 allows a controlled amount of oxygen
   enriched gas to be sent from canister 304 to 302. In an embodiment, the controlled amount of
15 oxygen enriched gas is an amount sufficient to purge canister 302 and minimize the loss of
   oxygen enriched gas through venting valve 132 of canister 302.             While this embodiment
   describes venting of canister 302, it should be understood that the same process can be used to
   vent canister 304 using flow restrictor 151, valve 152 and flow restrictor 153.
            The pair of equalization/vent valves 152/154 work with flow restrictors 153 and 155 to
20 optimize the air flow balance between the two canisters. This may allow for better flow control
   for venting the canisters with oxygen enriched gas from the other of the canisters. It may also
   provide better flow direction between the two canisters. It has been found that, while flow valves
   152/154 may be operated as bi-directional valves, the flow rate through such valves varies
   depending on the direction of fluid flowing through the valve. For example, oxygen enriched gas
25 flowing from canister 304 toward canister 302 has a flow rate faster through valve 152 than the
   flow rate of oxygen enriched gas flowing from canister 302 toward canister 304 through valve
   152. If a single valve was to be used, eventually either too much or too little oxygen enriched
   gas would be sent between the canisters and the canisters would, over time, begin to produce
   different amounts of oxygen enriched gas.         Use of opposing valves and flow restrictors on
30 parallel air pathways may equalize the flow pattern of the oxygen between the two canisters.
   Equalizing the flow may allow for a steady amount of oxygen available to the user over multiple
   cycles and also may allow a predictable volume of oxygen to purge the other of the canisters. In
   some embodiments, the air pathway may not have restrictors but may instead have a valve with a
   built in resistance or the air pathway itself may have a narrow radius to provide resistance.
                                                   Page 11

           At times, oxygen concentrator may be shut down for a period of time. When an oxygen
   concentrator is shut down, the temperature inside the canisters may drop as a result of the loss of
   adiabatic heat from the compression system. As the temperature drops, the volume occupied by
   the gases inside the canisters will drop. Cooling of the canisters may lead to a negative pressure
 5 in the canisters. Valves (e.g., valves 122, 124, 132, and 134) leading to and from the canisters
   are dynamically sealed rather than hermetically sealed. Thus, outside air may enter the canisters
   after shutdown to accommodate the pressure differential. When outside air enters the canisters,
   moisture from the outside air may condense inside the canister as the air cools. Condensation of
   water inside the canisters may lead to gradual degradation of the gas separation adsorbents,
10 steadily reducing ability of the gas separation adsorbents to produce oxygen enriched gas.
            In an embodiment, outside air may be inhibited from entering canisters after the oxygen
   concentrator is shut down by pressurizing both canisters prior to shut down. By storing the
   canisters under a positive pressure, the valves may be forced into a hermetically closed position
   by the internal pressure of the air in the canisters.      In an embodiment, the pressure in the
15 canisters, at shutdown, should be at least greater than ambient pressure. As used herein the term
   "ambient pressure" refers to the pressure of the surroundings that the oxygen generator is located
   (e.g. the pressure inside a room, outside, in a plane, etc.). In an embodiment, the pressure in the
   canisters, at shutdown, is at least greater than standard atmospheric pressure (i.e., greater than
   760 mmHg (Torr), 1 atm, 101,325 Pa).           In an embodiment, the pressure in the canisters, at
20 shutdown, is at least about 1.1 times greater than ambient pressure; is at least about 1.5 times
   greater than ambient pressure; or is at least about 2 times greater than ambient pressure.
            In an embodiment, pressurization of the canisters may be achieved by directing
   pressurized air into each canister from the compression system and closing all valves to trap the
   pressurized air in the canisters.   In an exemplary embodiment, when a shutdown sequence is
25 initiated, inlet valves 122 and 124 are opened and outlet valves 132 and 134 are closed. Because
   inlet valves 122 and 124 are joined together by a common conduit, both canisters 302 and 304
   may become pressurized as air and or oxygen enriched gas from one canister may be transferred
   to the other canister.    This situation may occur when the pathway between the compression
   system and the two inlet valves allows such transfer. Because the oxygen generator operates in
30 an alternating pressurize/venting mode, at least one of the canisters should be in a pressurized
   state at any given time.     In an alternate embodiment, the pressure may be increased in each
   canister by operation of compression system 200. When inlet valves 122 and 124 are opened,
   pressure between canisters 302 and 304 will equalize, however, the equalized pressure in either
   canister may not be sufficient to inhibit air from entering the canisters during shutdown. In order
                                                    Page 12

   to ensure that air is inhibited from entering the canisters, compression system 200 may be
   operated for a time sufficient to increase the pressure inside both canisters to a level at least
   greater than ambient pressure. Regardless of the method of pressurization of the canisters, once
   the canisters are pressurized, inlet valves 122 and 124 are closed, trapping the pressurized air
 5 inside the canisters, which inhibits air from entering the canisters during the shutdown period.
           An outlet system, coupled to one or more of the canisters, includes one or more conduits
   for providing oxygen enriched gas to a user. In an embodiment, oxygen enriched gas produced
   in either of canisters 302 and 304 is collected in accumulator 106 through check valves 142 and
   144, respectively, as depicted schematically in FIG. 1. The oxygen enriched gas leaving the
10 canisters may be collected in oxygen accumulator 106 prior to being provided to a user. In some
   embodiments, a tube may be coupled to accumulator 106 to provide the oxygen enriched gas to
   the user. Oxygen enriched gas may be provided to the user through an airway delivery device
   that transfer the oxygen enriched gas to the user's mouth and/or nose. In an embodiment, an
   outlet may include a tube that directs the oxygen toward a user's nose and/or mouth that may not
15 be directly coupled to the user's nose.
           Turning to FIG. 2, a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an outlet system for an
   oxygen concentrator is shown. Supply valve 160 may be coupled to outlet tube to control the
   release of the oxygen enriched gas from accumulator 106 to the user. In an embodiment, supply
   valve 160 is an electromagnetically actuated plunger valve. Supply valve 160 is actuated by
20 controller 400 to control the delivery of oxygen enriched gas to a user. Actuation of supply valve
   160 is not timed or synchronized to the pressure swing adsorption process. Instead, actuation is,
   in some embodiments, synchronized to the patient's breathing. Additionally, supply valve 160
   may have multiple actuations to help establish a clinically effective flow profile for providing
   oxygen enriched gas.
25         Oxygen enriched gas in accumulator 106 passes through supply valve 160 into expansion
   chamber 170 as depicted in FIG. 2. In an embodiment, expansion chamber may include one or
   more devices capable of being used to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through
   the chamber. Oxygen enriched gas in expansion chamber 170 builds briefly, through release of
   gas from accumulator by supply valve 160, and then is bled through small orifice flow restrictor
30 175 to flow rate sensor 185 and then to particulate filter 187. Flow restrictor 175 may be a 0.025
   D flow restrictor. Other flow restrictor types and sizes may be used. In some embodiments, the
   diameter of the air pathway in the housing may be restricted to create restricted air flow. Flow
   rate sensor 185 may be any sensor capable of assessing the rate of gas flowing through the
   conduit. Particulate filter 187 may be used to filter bacteria, dust, granule particles, etc. prior to
                                                   Page 13

   delivery of the oxygen enriched gas to the user. The oxygen enriched gas passes through filter
   187 to connector 190 which sends the oxygen enriched gas to the user via conduit 192 and to
   pressure sensor 194.
           The fluid dynamics of the outlet pathway, coupled with the programmed actuations of
 5 supply valve 160, results in a bolus of oxygen being provided at the correct time and with a flow
   profile that assures rapid delivery into the patient's lungs without any excessive flow rates that
   would result in wasted retrograde flow out the nostrils and into the atmosphere.          It has been
   found, in our specific system, that the total volume of the bolus required for prescriptions is equal
   to 11 mL for each LPM, i.e., 11 mL for a prescription of 1 LPM; 22 mL for a prescription of 2
10 LPM; 33 mL for a prescription of 3 LPM; 44 mL for a prescription of 4 LPM; 55 mL for a
   prescription of 5 LPM; etc. This is generally referred to as the LPM equivalent. It should be
   understood that the LPM equivalent may vary between apparatus due to differences in
   construction design, tubing size, chamber size, etc.
           Expansion chamber 170 may include one or more oxygen sensors capable of being used
15 to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through the chamber. In an embodiment,
   the oxygen concentration of gas passing through expansion chamber 170 is assessed using
   oxygen sensor 165.       An oxygen sensor is a device capable of detecting oxygen in a gas.
   Examples of oxygen sensors include, but are not limited to, ultrasonic oxygen sensors, electrical
   oxygen sensors, and optical oxygen sensors.         In one embodiment, oxygen sensor 165 is an
20 ultrasonic oxygen sensor that includes ultrasonic emitter 166 and ultrasonic receiver 168.         In
   some embodiments, ultrasonic emitter 166 may include multiple ultrasonic emitters and
   ultrasonic receiver 168 may include multiple ultrasonic receivers.         In embodiments having
   multiple emitters/receivers, the multiple ultrasonic emitters and multiple ultrasonic receivers may
   be axially aligned (e.g., across the gas mixture flow path which may be perpendicular to the axial
25 alignment).
           In use, an ultrasonic sound wave (from emitter 166) may be directed through oxygen
   enriched gas disposed in chamber 170 to receiver 168. Ultrasonic sensor assembly may be based
   on detecting the speed of sound through the gas mixture to determine the composition of the gas
   mixture (e.g., the speed of sound is different in nitrogen and oxygen). In a mixture of the two
30 gases, the speed of sound through the mixture may be an intermediate value proportional to the
   relative amounts of each gas in the mixture. In use, the sound at the receiver 168 is slightly out
   of phase with the sound sent from emitter 166. This phase shift is due to the relatively slow
   velocity of sound through a gas medium as compared with the relatively fast speed of the
   electronic pulse through wire. The phase shift, then, is proportional to the distance between the
                                                   Page 14

   emitter and the receiver and the speed of sound through the expansion chamber. The density of
   the gas in the chamber affects the speed of sound through the chamber and the density is
   proportional to the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the chamber. Therefore, the phase shift can be
   used to measure the concentration of oxygen in the expansion chamber.           In this manner the
 5 relative concentration of oxygen in the accumulation chamber may be assessed as a function of
   one or more properties of a detected sound wave traveling through the accumulation chamber.
            In some embodiments, multiple emitters 166 and receivers 168 may be used.             The
   readings from the emitters 166 and receivers 168 may be averaged to cancel errors that may be
   inherent in turbulent flow systems. In some embodiments, the presence of other gases may also
10 be detected by measuring the transit time and comparing the measured transit time to
   predetermined transit times for other gases and/or mixtures of gases.
            The sensitivity of the ultrasonic sensor system may be increased by increasing the
   distance between emitter 166 and receiver 168, for example to allow several sound wave cycles
   to occur between emitter 166 and the receiver 168. In some embodiments, if at least two sound
15 cycles are present, the influence of structural changes of the transducer may be reduced by
   measuring the phase shift relative to a fixed reference at two points in time. If the earlier phase
   shift is subtracted from the later phase shift, the shift caused by thermal expansion of expansion
   chamber 170 may be reduced or cancelled. The shift caused by a change of the distance between
   emitter 166 and receiver 168 may be the approximately the same at the measuring intervals,
20 whereas a change owing to a change in oxygen concentration may be cumulative.              In some
   embodiments, the shift measured at a later time may be multiplied by the number of intervening
   cycles and compared to the shift between two adjacent cycles. Further details regarding sensing
   of oxygen in the expansion chamber may be found, for example, in U.S. Published Patent
   Application No. 2009-0065007, published March 12, 2009, and entitled "Oxygen Concentrator
25 Apparatus and Method, which is incorporated herein by reference.
            Flow rate sensor 185 may be used to determine the flow rate of gas flowing through the
   outlet system.      Flow rate sensors that may be used include, but are not limited to:
   diaphragm/bellows flow meters; rotary flow meters (e.g. Hall Effect flow meters); turbine flow
   meters; orifice flow meters; and ultrasonic flow meters. Flow rate sensor 185 may be coupled to
30 controller 400. The rate of gas flowing through the outlet system may be an indication of the
   breathing volume of the user. Changes in the flow rate of gas flowing through the outlet system
   may also be used to determine a breathing rate of the user. Controller 400 may control actuation
   of supply valve 160 based on the breathing rate and/or breathing volume of the user, as assessed
   by flow rate sensor 185.
                                                   Page 15

            In some embodiments, ultrasonic sensor system 165 and, for example, flow rate sensor
   185 may provide a measurement of an actual amount of oxygen being provided. For example,
   follow rate sensor 185 may measure a volume of gas (based on flow rate) provided and ultrasonic
   sensor system 165 may provide the concentration of oxygen of the gas provided. These two
 5 measurements together may be used by controller 400 to determine an approximation of the
   actual amount of oxygen provided to the user.
            Oxygen enriched gas passes through flow meter 185 to filter 187. Filter 187 removes
   bacteria, dust, granule particles, etc. prior to providing the oxygen enriched gas to the user. The
   filtered oxygen enriched gas passes through filter 187 to connector 190. Connector 190 may be a
10 "Y" connector coupling the outlet of filter 187 to pressure sensor 194 and outlet conduit 192.
   Pressure sensor 194 may be used to monitor the pressure of the gas passing through conduit 192
   to the user. Changes in pressure, sensed by pressure sensor 194, may be used to determine a
   breathing rate of a user, as well as the onset of inhalation. Controller 400 may control actuation
   of supply valve 160 based on the breathing rate and/or onset of inhalation of the user, as assessed
15 by pressure sensor 194. In an embodiment, controller 400 may control actuation of supply valve
   160 based on information provided by flow rate sensor 185 and pressure sensor 194.
            Oxygen enriched gas may be provided to a user through conduit 192. In an embodiment,
   conduit 192 may be a silicone tube. Conduit 192 may be coupled to a user using an airway
   coupling member 196, as depicted in FIG. 3. Airway coupling member 196 may be any device
20 capable of providing the oxygen enriched gas to nasal cavities or oral cavities. Examples of
   airway coupling members include, but are not limited to: nasal masks, nasal pillows, nasal
   prongs, nasal cannulas, and mouthpieces. A nasal cannula airway delivery device is depicted in
   FIG. 3. During use, oxygen enriched gas from oxygen concentrator system 100 is provided to
   the user through conduit 192 and airway coupling member 196. Airway coupling member 196 is
25 positioned proximate to a user's airway (e.g., proximate to the user's mouth and or nose) to allow
   delivery of the oxygen enriched gas to the user while allowing the user to breath air from the
   surroundings.
   Canister System
            Oxygen concentrator system 100 may include at least two canisters, each canister
30 including a gas separation adsorbent. The canisters of oxygen concentrator system 100 may be
   disposed formed from a molded housing. In an embodiment, canister system 300 includes two
   housing components 310 and 510, as depicted in FIG. 4. The housing components 310 and 510
   may be formed separately and then coupled together.               In some embodiments, housing
   components 310 and 510 may be injection molded or compression molded. Housing components
                                                    Page 16

   310 and 510 may be made from a thermoplastic polymer such as polycarbonate, methylene
   carbide, polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene, polyethylene, or
   polyvinyl chloride. In another embodiment, housing components 310 and 510 may be made of a
   thermoset plastic or metal (such as stainless steel or a light-weight aluminum alloy). Lightweight
 5 materials may be used to reduce the weight of the oxygen concentrator 100.                 In some
   embodiments, the two housings 310 and 510 may be fastened together using screws or bolts.
   Alternatively, housing components 310 and 510 may be solvent welded together.
           As shown, valve seats 320, 322, 324, and 326 and air pathways 330 and 332 may be
   integrated into the housing component 310 to reduce the number of sealed connections needed
10 throughout the air flow of the oxygen concentrator 100. In various embodiments, the housing
   components 310 and 410 of the oxygen concentrator 100 may form a two-part molded plastic
   frame that defines two canisters 302 and 304 and accumulation chamber 106.
           Air pathways/tubing between different sections in housing components 310 and 510 may
   take the form of molded conduits. Conduits in the form of molded channels for air pathways
15 may occupy multiple planes in housing components 310 and 510. For example, the molded air
   conduits may be formed at different depths and at different x,y,z positions in housing
   components 310 and 510. In some embodiments, a majority or substantially all of the conduits
   may be integrated into the housing components 310 and 510 to reduce potential leak points.
           In some embodiments, prior to coupling housing components 310 and 510 together, 0
20 rings may be placed between various points of housing components 310 and 510 to ensure that
   the housing components are properly sealed.            In some embodiments, components may be
   integrated and/or coupled separately to housing components 310 and 510. For example, tubing,
   flow restrictors (e.g., press fit flow restrictors), oxygen sensors, gas separation adsorbents 139,
   check valves, plugs, processors, power supplies, etc. may be coupled to housing components 510
25 and 410 before and/or after the housing components are coupled together.
           In some embodiments, apertures 337 leading to the exterior of housing components 310
   and 410 may be used to insert devices such as flow restrictors. Apertures may also be used for
   increased moldability. One or more of the apertures may be plugged after molding (e.g., with a
   plastic plug).   In some embodiments, flow restrictors may be inserted into passages prior to
30 inserting plug to seal the passage. Press fit flow restrictors may have diameters that may allow a
   friction fit between the press fit flow restrictors and their respective apertures.        In some
   embodiments, an adhesive may be added to the exterior of the press fit flow restrictors to hold the
   press fit flow restrictors in place once inserted. In some embodiments, the plugs may have a
   friction fit with their respective tubes (or may have an adhesive applied to their outer surface).
                                                    Page 17

   The press fit flow restrictors and/or other components may be inserted and pressed into their
   respective apertures using a narrow tip tool or rod (e.g., with a diameter less than the diameter of
   the respective aperture). In some embodiments, the press fit flow restrictors may be inserted into
   their respective tubes until they abut a feature in the tube to halt their insertion. For example, the
 5 feature may include a reduction in radius. Other features are also contemplated (e.g., a bump in
   the side of the tubing, threads, etc.). In some embodiments, press fit flow restrictors may be
   molded into the housing components (e.g., as narrow tube segments).
            In some embodiments, spring baffle 129 may be placed into respective canister receiving
   portions of housing component 310 and 510 with the spring side of the baffle 129 facing the exit
10 of the canister. Spring baffle 129 may apply force to gas separation adsorbent 139 in the canister
   while also assisting in preventing gas separation adsorbent 139 from entering the exit apertures.
   Use of a spring baffle 129 may keep the gas separation adsorbent compact while also allowing
   for expansion (e.g., thermal expansion). Keeping the gas separation adsorbent 139 compact may
   prevent the gas separation adsorbent from breaking during movement of the oxygen concentrator
15 system 100).
            In some embodiments, pressurized air from the compression system 200 may enter air
   inlet 306. Air inlet 306 is coupled to inlet conduit 330. Air enters housing component 310
   through inlet 306 travels through conduit 330, and then to valve seats 322 and 324. FIG. 5 and
   FIG. 6 depict an end view of housing 310. FIG. 5, depicts an end view of housing 310 prior to
20 fitting valves to housing 310. FIG. 6 depicts an end view of housing 310 with the valves fitted to
   the housing 310. Valve seats 322 and 324 are configured to receive inlet valves 122 and 124
   respectively. Inlet valve 122 is coupled to canister 302 and inlet valve 124 is coupled to canister
   304. Housing 310 also includes valve seats 332 and 334 configured to receive outlet valves 132
   and 134 respectively. Outlet valve 132 is coupled to canister 302 and outlet valve 134 is coupled
25 to canister 304. Inlet valves 122/124 are used to control the passage of air from conduit 330 to
   the respective canisters.
            In an embodiment, pressurized air is sent into one of canisters 302 or 304 while the other
   canister is being vented. For example, during use, inlet valve 122 is opened while inlet valve 124
   is closed. Pressurized air from compression system 200 is forced into canister 302, while being
30 inhibited from entering canister 304 by inlet valve 124. During pressurization of canister 302,
   outlet valve 132 is closed and outlet valve 134 is opened.         Similar to the inlet valves, outlet
   valves 132 and 134 are operated out of phase with each other. Each inlet valve seat 322 includes
   an opening 375 that passes through housing 310 into canister 302.            Similarly valve seat 324
   includes an opening 325 that passes through housing 310 into canister 302. Air from conduit 330
                                                   Page 18

   passes through openings 323, or 325 if the respective valve (322 or 324) is open, and enters a
   canister.
           Check valves 142 and 144 (See, FIG. 4) are coupled to canisters 302 and 304,
   respectively. Check valves 142 and 144 are one way valves that are passively operated by the
 5 pressure differentials that occur as the canisters are pressurized and vented. Oxygen enriched
   gas, produced in canisters 302 and 304 pass from the canister into openings 542 and 544 of
   housing 410.    A passage (not shown) links openings 542 and 544 to conduits 342 and 344,
   respectively.   Oxygen enriched gas produced in canister 302 passes from the canister though
   opening 542 and into conduit 342 when the pressure in the canister is sufficient to open check
10 valve 142.    When check valve 142 is open, oxygen enriched gas flows through conduit 342
   toward the end of housing 310. Similarly, oxygen enriched gas produced in canister 304 passes
   from the canister though opening 544 and into conduit 344 when the pressure in the canister is
   sufficient to open check valve 144. When check valve 144 is open, oxygen enriched gas flows
   through conduit 344 toward the end of housing 310.
15         Oxygen enriched gas from either canister, travels through conduit 342 or 344 and enters
   conduit 346 formed in housing 310. Conduit 346 includes openings that couple the conduit to
   conduit 342, conduit 344 and accumulator 106. Thus oxygen enriched gas, produced in canister
   302 or 304, travels to conduit 346 and passes into accumulator 106.
           After some time the gas separation adsorbent will become saturated with nitrogen and
20 will be unable to separate significant amounts of nitrogen from incoming air. When the gas
   separation adsorbent in a canister reaches this saturation point, the inflow of compressed air is
   stopped and the canister is vented to remove nitrogen. Canister 302 is vented by closing inlet
   valve 122 and opening outlet valve 132. Outlet valve 132 releases the vented gas from canister
   302 into the volume defined by the end of housing 310. Foam material may cover the end of
25 housing 310 to reduce the sound made by release of gases from the canisters. Similarly, canister
   304 is vented by closing inlet valve 124 and opening outlet valve 134. Outlet valve 134 releases
   the vented gas from canister 304 into the volume defined by the end of housing 310.
           While canister 302 is being vented, canister 304 is pressurized to produce oxygen
   enriched gas in the same manner described above. Pressurization of canister 304 is achieved by
30 closing outlet valve 134 and opening inlet valve 124. The oxygen enriched gas exits canister 304
   through check valve 144.
           In an exemplary embodiment, a portion of the oxygen enriched gas may be transferred
   from canister 302 to canister 304 when canister 304 is being vented of nitrogen. Transfer of
   oxygen enriched gas from canister 302 to canister 304, during venting of canister 304, helps to
                                                  Page 19

   further purge nitrogen (and other gases) from the canister. Flow of oxygen enriched gas between
   the canisters is controlled using flow restrictors and valves, as depicted in FIG. 1. Three conduits
   are formed in housing 510 for use in transferring oxygen enriched gas between canisters. As
   shown in FIG. 7, conduit 530 couples canister 302 to canister 304. Flow restrictor 151 (not
 5 shown) is disposed in conduit 530, between canister 302 and canister 304 to restrict flow of
   oxygen enriched gas during use. Conduit 532 also couples canister 302 to 304. Conduit 532 is
   coupled to valve seat 552 which receives valve 152, as shown in FIG. 8. Flow restrictor 153 (not
   shown) is disposed in conduit 532, between canister 302 and 304. Conduit 534 also couples
   canister 302 to 304. Conduit 534 is coupled to valve seat 554 which receives valve 154, as
10 shown in FIG. 8. Flow restrictor 155 (not shown) is disposed in conduit 434, between canister
   302 and 304. The pair of equalization/vent valves 152/154 work with flow restrictors 153 and
   155 to optimize the air flow balance between the two canisters.
           Oxygen enriched gas in accumulator 106 passes through supply valve 160 into expansion
   chamber 170 which is formed in housing 510. An opening (not shown) in housing 510 couples
15 accumulator 106 to supply valve 160. In an embodiment, expansion chamber may include one or
   more devices capable of being used to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through
   the chamber.
   Controller System
           Operation of oxygen concentrator system 100 may be performed automatically using an
20 internal controller 400 coupled to various components of the oxygen concentrator system, as
   described herein. Controller 400 includes one or more processors 410 and internal memory 420,
   as depicted in FIG. 1. Methods used to operate and monitor oxygen concentrator system 100
   may be implemented by program instructions stored in memory 420 or a carrier medium coupled
   to controller 400, and executed by one or more processors 410.            A non-transitory memory
25 medium may include any of various types of memory devices or storage devices. The term
   "memory medium" is intended to include an installation medium, e.g., a Compact Disc Read
   Only Memory (CD-ROM), floppy disks, or tape device; a computer system memory or random
   access memory such as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Double Data Rate Random
   Access Memory (DDR RAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Extended Data Out
30 Random Access Memory (EDO RAM), Rambus Random Access Memory (RAM), etc.; or a non
   volatile memory such as a magnetic media, e.g., a hard drive, or optical storage. The memory
   medium may comprise other types of memory as well, or combinations thereof. In addition, the
   memory medium may be located in a first computer in which the programs are executed, or may
   be located in a second different computer that connects to the first computer over a network, such
                                                    Page 20

   as the Internet. In the latter instance, the second computer may provide program instructions to
   the first computer for execution. The term "memory medium" may include two or more memory
   mediums that may reside in different locations, e.g., in different computers that are connected
   over a network.
 5          In some embodiments, controller 400 includes processor 410 that includes, for example,
   one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microcontrollers, etc. included on a circuit
   board disposed in oxygen concentrator system 100. Processor 410 is capable of executing
   programming instructions stored in memory 420.             In some embodiments, programming
   instructions may be built into processor 410 such that a memory external to the processor may
10 not be separately accessed (i.e., the memory 420 may be internal to the processor 410).
            Processor 410 may be coupled to various components of oxygen concentrator system 100,
   including, but not limited to compression system 200, one or more of the valves used to control
   fluid flow through the system (e.g., valves 122, 124, 132, 134, 152, 154, 160, or combinations
   thereof), oxygen sensor 165, pressure sensor 194, flow rate monitor 180, temperature sensors,
15 fans, and any other component that may be electrically controlled. In some embodiments, a
   separate processor (and/or memory) may be coupled to one or more of the components.
            Controller 400 is programmed to operate oxygen concentrator system 100 and is further
   programmed to monitor the oxygen concentrator system for malfunction states. For example, in
   one embodiment, controller 400 is programmed to trigger an alarm if the system is operating and
20 no breathing is detected by the user for a predetermined amount of time.          For example, if
   controller 400 does not detect a breath for a period of 75 seconds, an alarm LED may be lit
   and/or an audible alarm may be sounded. If the user has truly stopped breathing, for example,
   during a sleep apnea episode, the alarm may be sufficient to awaken the user, causing the user to
   resume breathing. The action of breathing may be sufficient for controller 400 to reset this alarm
25 function. Alternatively, if the system is accidently left on when output conduit 192 is removed
   from the user, the alarm may serve as a reminder for the user to turn oxygen concentrator system
   100 off.
            Controller 400 is further coupled to oxygen sensor 165, and may be programmed for
   continuous or periodic monitoring of the oxygen concentration of the oxygen enriched gas
30 passing through expansion chamber 170. A minimum oxygen concentration threshold may be
   programmed into controller 400, such that the controller lights an LED visual alarm and/or an
   audible alarm to warn the patient of the low concentration of oxygen.
            Controller 400 is also coupled to internal power supply 180 and is capable of monitoring
   the level of charge of the internal power supply. A minimum voltage and/or current threshold
                                                   Page 21

   may be programmed into controller 400, such that the controller lights an LED visual alarm
   and/or an audible alarm to warn the patient of low power condition. The alarms may be activated
   intermittently and at an increasing frequency as the battery approaches zero usable charge.
            Further functions of controller 400 are described in detail in other sections of this
 5 disclosure.
           A user may have a low breathing rate or depth if relatively inactive (e.g., asleep, sitting,
   etc.) as assessed by comparing the detected breathing rate or depth to a threshold. The user may
   have a high breathing rate or depth if relatively active (e.g., walking, exercising, etc.). An
   active/sleep mode may be assessed automatically and/or the user may manually indicate a
10 respective active or sleep mode by a pressing button for active mode and another button for sleep
   mode. In some embodiments, a user may toggle a switch from active mode, normal mode, or
   sedentary mode.      The adjustments made by the oxygen concentrator system in response to
   activating active mode or sleep mode are described in more detail herein.
   Methods of Delivery of Oxygen Enriched Gas
15          The main use of an oxygen concentrator system is to provide supplemental oxygen to a
   user. Generally, the amount of supplemental oxygen to be provided is assessed by a physician.
   Typical prescribed amounts of supplemental oxygen may range from about 1 LPM to up to about
   10 LPM. The most commonly prescribed amounts are 1 LPM, 2 LPM, 3 LPM, and 4 LPM.
   Generally, oxygen enriched gas is provided to the use during a breathing cycle to meet the
20 prescription requirement of the user. As used herein the term "breathing cycle" refers to an
   inhalation followed by an exhalation of a person.
            In order to minimize the amount of oxygen enriched gas that is needed to be produced to
   meet the prescribed amounts, controller 400 may be programmed to time delivery of the oxygen
   enriched gas with the user's inhalations. Releasing the oxygen enriched gas to the user as the
25 user inhales may prevent unnecessary oxygen generation (further reducing power requirements)
   by not releasing oxygen, for example, when the user is exhaling.         Reducing the amount of
   oxygen required may effectively reduce the amount of air compressing needed for oxygen
   concentrator 100 (and subsequently may reduce the power demand from the compressors).
            Oxygen enriched gas, produced by oxygen concentrator system 100 is stored in an
30 oxygen accumulator 106 and released to the user as the user inhales.       The amount of oxygen
   enriched gas provided by the oxygen concentrator system is controlled, in part, by supply valve
   160. In an embodiment, supply valve 160 is opened for a sufficient amount of time to provide
   the appropriate amount of oxygen enriched gas, as assessed by controller 400, to the user. In
   order to minimize the amount of oxygen required to meet the prescription requirements of a user,
                                                 Page 22

   the oxygen enriched gas may be provided in a bolus when a user's inhalation is first detected.
   For example, the bolus of oxygen enriched gas may be provided in the first few milliseconds of a
   user's inhalation.
           In an embodiment, pressure sensor 194 and/or flow rate sensor 185 may be used to
 5 determine the onset of inhalation by the user. For example, the user's inhalation may be detected
   by using pressure sensor 194. In use, a conduit for providing oxygen enriched gas is coupled to a
   user's nose and/or mouth (e.g., using a nasal cannula or a face mask). At the onset of an
   inhalation, the user begins to draw air into their body through the nose and/or mouth. As the air
   is drawn in, a negative pressure is generated at the end of the conduit, due, in part, to the venturi
10 action of the air being drawn across the end of the delivery conduit. Pressure sensor 194 may be
   operable to create a signal when a drop in pressure is detected, to signal the onset of inhalation.
   Upon detection of the onset of inhalation, supply valve 160 is controlled to release a bolus of
   oxygen enriched gas from the accumulator 106.
           In some embodiments, pressure sensor 194 may provide a signal that is proportional to
15 the amount of positive or negative pressure applied to a sensing surface. The amount of the
   pressure change detected by pressure sensor 194 may be used to refine the amount of oxygen
   enriched gas being provided to the user. For example, if a large negative pressure change is
   detected by pressure sensor 194, the volume of oxygen enriched gas provided to the user may be
   increased to take into account the increased volume of gas being inhaled by the user. If a smaller
20 negative pressure is detected, the volume of oxygen enriched gas provided to the user may be
   decreased to take into account the decreased volume of gas being inhaled by the user. A positive
   change in the pressure indicates an exhalation by the user and is generally a time that release of
   oxygen enriched gas is discontinued. Generally while a positive pressure change is sensed, valve
   160 remains closed until the next onset of inhalation.
25         In some embodiments, the sensitivity of the pressure sensor 194 may be affected by the
   physical distance of the pressure sensor 194 from the user, especially if the pressure sensor is
   located in oxygen concentrator system 100 and the pressure difference is detected through the
   tubing coupling the oxygen concentrator system to the user. In some embodiments, the pressure
   sensor may be placed in the airway delivery device used to provide the oxygen enriched gas to
30 the user. A signal from the pressure sensor may be provided to controller 400 in the oxygen
   concentrator 100 electronically via a wire or through telemetry such as through BLUETOOTH@
   (Bluetooth, SIG, Inc. Kirkland, Washington) or other wireless technology.
           In an embodiment, the user's inhalation may be detected by using flow rate sensor 185.
   In use, a conduit for providing oxygen enriched gas is coupled to a user's nose and/or mouth
                                                  Page 23

   (e.g., using a nasal cannula or face mask). At the onset of an inhalation, the user begins to draw
   air into their body through the nose and/or mouth. As the air is drawn in, an increase in flow of
   gas passing through conduit is created. Flow rate sensor 185 may be operable to create a signal
   when an increase in flow rate is detected, to signal the onset of inhalation. Upon detection of the
 5 onset of inhalation, supply valve 160 is controlled to release a bolus of oxygen enriched gas from
   the accumulator 106.
           A user breathing at a rate of 30 breaths per minute (BPM) during an active state (e.g.,
   walking, exercising, etc.) may consume two and one-half times as much oxygen as a user who is
   breathing at 12 BPM during a sedentary state (e.g., asleep, sitting, etc.). Pressure sensor 194
10 and/or flow rate sensor 185 may be used to determine the breathing rate of the user. Controller
   400 may process information received from pressure sensor 194 and/or flow rate sensor 185 and
   determine a breathing rate based on the frequency of the onset of inhalation.         The detected
   breathing rate of the user may be used to adjust the bolus of oxygen enriched gas. The volume of
   the bolus of oxygen enriched gas may be increased as the users breathing rate increase, and may
15 be decreased as the users breathing rate decreases. Controller 400 may automatically adjust the
   bolus based on the detected activity state of the user. Alternatively, the user may manually
   indicate a respective active or sedentary mode by selecting the appropriate option on the control
   panel of the oxygen concentrator. Alternatively, a user may operate controller 400 from a remote
   electronic device. For example, a user may operate the controller using a smart phone or tablet
20 device.
            In some embodiments, if the user's current activity level as assessed using the detected
   user's breathing rate exceeds a predetermined threshold, controller 400 may implement an alarm
   (e.g., visual and/or audio) to warn the user that the current breathing rate is exceeding the
   delivery capacity of the oxygen concentrator system. For example, the threshold may be set at 20
25 breaths per minute.
            Methods of determining the breathing rate of a user typically count the number of
   breathes taken by the user over a pre-determined time and calculate the breathing rate. When
   determining the breathing rate of a user, all breaths measured during the pre-determined time
   period are typically used to calculate the breathing rate. Such a method, however, can lead to
30 significant errors due to sudden changes in the breathing rate of the user. For example, while
   sleeping it is know that the times between breaths may vary greatly for an individual. Breathing
   patterns normally change during sleep. During deep sleep, breathing slows and becomes lighter
   as the body rests. During light sleep and REM, breathing can resemble breathing patterns of the
   person when awake. Periods of heavy breathing may also occur during dreams.             Changes in
                                                  Page 24

   breathing rate can occur quickly while a user is sleeping and even during awake periods. If the
   delivery of oxygen enriched gas is not adapted to the breathing patterns of the user properly,
   oxygen enriched gas may be wasted, by providing the oxygen enriched gas for too long, or may
   be insufficient, if the oxygen enriched gas is provided for too short a period.
 5         Attempts have been made to take into account the erratic breathing of a user.              For
   example, U.S. Patent No. 7,841,343 to Deane et al. ("Deane") described the use of a blind time to
   help compensate for erratic breathing.     Specifically, Deane teaches that after a bolus of oxygen
   enriched gas is delivered to a user, a controller enters a blind time. During this blind time the
   controller will not accept any triggers to deliver oxygen enriched gas. This time may range from
10 0.5 to 3 seconds after the bolus is delivered. After this blind time has elapsed the controller sets
   the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a low level and gradually increases the sensitivity
   until a breath is detected. According to Deane, this helps to vary the bolus delivery in response
   to changes in the users breathing.
           The method of Deane relies on a blind time in which no breaths are detected. Thus, if the
15 user starts breathing rapidly, shortly after the delivery of a bolus of oxygen enriched gas, the
   method of Deane may be delayed in reacting to the change in breathing. In the worst case
   scenario, the user may change to a breathing rate in which every other breath falls within the
   blind time, leading to the false indication that the user is breathing at a breathing rate that is half
   the actual breathing rate. Such a situation can lead to oxygen depravity in the individual due to
20 an insufficient amount of oxygen being supplied to the user.
           Applicant has devised an improved method of determining a breathing rate, and
   controlling the inspiration breath pressure threshold based on the determined breathings. In an
   embodiment, the controller determines the breathing rate based on measuring a predetermined
   number of breaths (at least three) and discarding information related to the last breath measured.
25 In this method the time between the penultimate breath and the last breath is not used to
   determine the average breathing rate.      The breathing rate, determined using the information
   collected from the remaining breaths, was found to give a more accurate indication of the current
   breathing rate of the user. Such a method also provides a way to take into account erratic
   breathing patterns without having to resort to the extreme measure of creating artificial "blind
30 times," as discussed in Deane.
           Over a period of time, controller 400 may collect and store the number of breaths. Based
   on the number of breaths, or the average time between breaths, over the period of time a
   breathing rate may be calculated. In some embodiments, the period of time is divided into equal
   time units. The number of breaths, or the average time between breaths, is determined in each
                                                   Page 25

   time unit for the set period of time. The number of breaths or average time between breaths, per
   time unit is used to determine a breathing rate. In some embodiments, the breathing rate in the
   last time unit is not used to determine if the delivery parameters should be changed. For
   example, if a period of time is broken up into 5 equal time units, the breathing rate determined
 5 for the last time unit is not used to determine an average breathing rate (for example, average
   breaths per minute).
             For example, controller 400 may collect the number of breaths over a 5 minute period of
   time. During the 5 minutes, a user may have a breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute ("BPM")
   for the first minute of the 5 minute time period, 10 BPM during the second minute of the 5
10 minute time period, 25 BPM during the third minute of the 5 minute time period, 30 BPM during
   the fourth minute of the 5 minute time period, and 40 BPM during the fifth minute of the 5
   minute time period. The 40 BPM may be ignored and the remaining breaths averaged (for
   example, to determine an average breathing rate of 20 BPM. The breathing rate determined
   during the last minute of the 5 minute time period may be used for averaging of the next 5 minute
15 time period. For example the last minute of the 5 minute time period may be used as the first
   minute of the next five minute time period. Alternatively, the five minute time period analyzed
   may be shifted by a minute. In this case, the second minute of the five minute period just
   analyzed becomes the first minute of the next five minute period. The fifth minute (ignored in
   the first breathing rate analysis), becomes the fourth minute of the next breathing rate analysis.
20 In either case the last minute is ignored in the breathing rate analysis.
             In another embodiment, the breathing rate may be determined by monitoring the time
   between each breath for at least three breaths. In some embodiments, the times between each of
   four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, or twenty successive breaths are
   measured and used to determine an average breathing rate. In this method the time between the
25 penultimate breath and the last breath is ignored, with the breathing rate based on the time
   between the breaths up to the penultimate breath. For example, if 5 successive breaths are used
   to determine a breathing rate, the time between the 4 th and               5 th breath is discarded when
   determining the breathing rate. For example if the following times between breaths are obtained:
     st-2nd: 4.5 sec., 2 nd 3 rd: 4.7 sec, 3 rd- 4 th - 4.2 sec, 4 th -5th: 5.2 sec, the average time between
30 breaths is determined by averaging the first three times (4.5 sec, 4.7 sec, and 4.2 sec) and
   ignoring the last breath (5.2 sec). In this manner the average time between breaths is 4.47, giving
   an average breathing rate of 13.4 breathes per minute.
             Using the average breathing rate, the inspiration breath pressure threshold may be
   adjusted relative to the current inspiration breath pressure threshold. Controller 400 may
                                                             Page 26

   determine that the average breathing rate has changed from less than 15 breaths per minute to
   greater than 15 breaths per minute. Controller 400 may send an electronic signal to pressure
   sensor 194 that raises the threshold breath pressure inspiration relative to the current inspiration
   breath pressure threshold. When the determined average breathing rate changes from greater
 5 than 10 breaths per minute to less than 10 breaths per minute, controller 400 may send an
   electronic signal to the pressure sensor 194 that lowers the inspiration breath pressure threshold
   relative to the current inspiration breath pressure threshold. Controller 400 may determine that
   the average breathing rate is between 10 breaths per minute and 15 breaths per minute, and
   determine that no change in the current inspiration breath pressure threshold is necessary. If the
10 average breathing rate is less than 5 breaths per minute then controller 400 may trigger an alarm.
   If the inspiration breath pressure threshold has been lowered relative to the current inspiration
   breath pressure threshold and no inspiration breath pressure is detected after a period of time (for
   example, 75 seconds), then controller 400 may trigger an alarm.
            In another embodiment, the change in the inspiration breath pressure threshold may be
15 adjusted by looking at the change in breathing rate over a predetermined period of time. For
   example, a change in breathing rate can be monitored by creating successive groupings of three
   or more breaths. For each successive grouping of three or more breaths, the breathing rate is
   determined (e.g., by calculating the breathing rate based on an average time between each breath
   in the grouping). The breathing rate from each grouping is compared to the next grouping to
20 determine how the breathing rate is changing. If the breathing rate is increasing over three or
   more successive groupings (e.g., the breathing rate increases in at least two of the groupings), the
   controller may increase the inspiration breath pressure threshold.          If the breathing rate is
   decreasing over three or more successive groupings (e.g., the breathing rate decreases in at least
   two of the groupings), the controller may lower the inspiration breath pressure threshold.
25          In a specific example, the time between each of seventeen successive breaths is measured.
   The breaths are then divided into four groupings, with each grouping having the inhalation times
   for four successive breaths. The groupings would then look as shown below, the number in
   parenthesis refers to the time between the breaths:
30                            1 (5.8s) 2 (5.0s) 3 (4.2s) 4                  BPM = 12
                              (4.0s) 5 (3.5s) 6 (3.5s) 7 (3.0s) 8           BPM = 17
                              (3.0s) 9 (3.4s) 10 (3.6s) 11 (3.5s) 12        BPM = 18
                              (2.6s) 13 (2.6s) 14 (2.4s) 15 (2.0s) 16       BPM = 25
                             (2.7s) 17
                                                     Page 27

   The last time (the time between breath 16 and 17, is not used to determine the breathing rate. In
   the above example, the first grouping (breaths 1-4) exhibits a breathing rate of 12 BPM. The
   second grouping exhibits a breathing rate of 17 BPM, which shows that the subjects breathing
   rate is increasing. Instead of changing the inspiration breath pressure threshold, the controller
 5 goes into a "watch" mode. In the "watch" mode the controller is alerted that a change in the
   inspiration breath pressure threshold may be needed.        The controller then looks at the third
   grouping. The third grouping exhibits a breathing rate of 18 BPM. A breathing rate that is
   within +/- 2 of the previous breathing rate, is not considered to have changed.            Since the
   breathing rate has not changed (as defined above) from the second grouping to the third
10 grouping, the controller remains in watch mode. The controller then looks at the change between
   the third and fourth groupings. The fourth grouping exhibits a breathing rate of 25 BPM. Since
   the controller has now seen a second increase among the four groupings measured, the controller
   increase the inspiration breath pressure threshold. The controller will continue to take additional
   groupings (in this example, of four successive breaths, excluding the last breath taken) and
15 continue to evaluate whether the inspiration breath pressure threshold should be adjusted.
           In some embodiments, rather than ignoring the last breath, the last grouping is ignored.
   For example, in the above example, the controller bases the decision to change the inspiration
   breath pressure threshold based on the first three groupings, ignoring the last ( 4 th) grouping.
   Under these circumstances, the inspiration breath pressure threshold is not changed until
20 additional groupings are taken and it is determined if the increase in breathing rate is continued.
           In alternate embodiments, the controller may base decisions on the actual BPM rather
   than the change in BPM. For example, if the BPM changes to less than 10 breaths per minute in
   a grouping, the controller may go into a watch mode. If the BPM remains below 10 BPM in one
   of the next two groupings, the controller may send an electronic signal to the pressure sensor that
25 lowers the inspiration breath pressure threshold relative to the current inspiration breath pressure
   threshold. If the BPM is between 10 breaths per minute and 15 breaths per minute, then no
   change is made to the inspiration breath pressure threshold. If the BPM changes to more than 15
   breaths per minute in a grouping, the controller may go into a watch mode. If the BPM remains
   above 15 BPM in one of the next two groupings, the controller may send an electronic signal to
30 the pressure sensor that increase the inspiration breath pressure threshold relative to the current
   inspiration breath pressure threshold. In this embodiment, as discussed above, the last breath
   detected or the last grouping measured may be ignored when determining if the inspiration breath
   pressure threshold should be changed.
                                                  Page 28

           In some embodiments, it is not necessary to calculate the breathing rate, but instead the
   time between breaths may be used in a decision making process. A flow chart of a process of
   adjusting the inspiration breath pressure threshold is shown in FIG. 10. During use, the times
   between at least three consecutives breaths is measured. When the time between, for example,
 5 the fourth breath and the fifth breath is measured, the controller determines if a change in the
   inspiration breath pressure threshold is needed. The times between breaths 1 and 2; 2 and 3; and
   3 and 4 are used to determine the average time between breaths. The time between breath 4 and
   breath 5 is not used to determine the average time between breaths. The average time between
   breaths 1-4 is then compared to predetermined values. In one embodiment, the subject is
10 considered to be in an active state if the average time between breaths is less than 4 seconds. It
   should be understood that other times can be used. Thus process therefore includes comparing
   the average time between breaths of the subject to the predetermined active state time. If the
   average time between breaths of the subject is less than the active state time, the controller sets
   the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a high pressure.
15         If the average time between breaths of the subject is greater than the active state time, the
   controller compares the time to an inactive state time. In one embodiment, the subject is
   considered to be in an inactive state if the average time between breaths is greater than 6 seconds.
   It should be understood that other times can be used. If the average time between breaths of the
   subject is greater than 6 seconds, the controller sets the inspiration breath pressure threshold to a
20 low pressure. If the average time between breaths of the subject is between 4 and 6 seconds, the
   controller does not change the inspiration breath pressure threshold.
           As shown in FIG. 10, when the breath 6 is taken, the process is repeated, however, the
   average is now based on the times between breath 2 and breath 5. Once the average time
   between breaths 2-5 is determined, the same process as discussed above is used to determine
25 whether the inspiration breath pressure threshold should be changed, and, if it should be changed,
   whether it should be set to a high pressure (active) or a low pressure (inactive). This process may
   be continued as long as oxygen is being provided to the user.
           In some embodiments, controller 400 may send a signal to adjust pressure sensor 194 to
   adjust the threshold inspiration breath pressure based on the ratio of the change in absolute
30 pressure with respect to time monitored over at least three breaths. In some embodiments, the
   change in absolute pressure with respect to time between each of four, five, six, seven, eight,
   nine, ten, fifteen or twenty successive breaths are measured and used to determine a ratio of
   change in absolute pressure with respect to time. Controller 400 may determine a ratio of the
   change in absolute pressure with respect to time based during a breathing period and store the
                                                   Page 29

   information in a non-transitory medium. Based on the determined ratio between the change in
   absolute pressure with respect to time, controller 400 may send an electronic signal to breath
   pressure sensor 194 that adjusts the inspiration breath pressure threshold. If ratio is assessed to
   be negative, and less than, or equal to, -0.5 controller 400 may send an electronic signal to breath
 5 pressure sensor 194 that lowers the inspiration breath pressure threshold relative to the current
   inspiration breath pressure threshold. For example, if the ratio is assessed to be about
   -1.5 to about -0.5, (i.e., less than or equal to -0.5), controller 400 may send an electronic signal to
   breath pressure sensor 194 that lowers the inspiration breath pressure threshold relative to the
   current inspiration breath pressure threshold. If the ratio is assessed to be slightly positive or
10 slightly negative (e.g., between -0.5 to +0.5), controller 400 may send an electronic signal to
   breath pressure sensor 194 that keeps the inspiration breath pressure threshold the same as the
   current inspiration breath pressure threshold. If the ratio is positive, and, for example, greater
   than or equal to +0.5, for example, controller 400 may send an electronic signal to breath
   pressure sensor 194 that raises the inspiration breath pressure threshold relative to the current
15 inspiration breath pressure threshold.
           In some embodiments, controller 400 may operate the oxygen concentrator based on the
   change in the inspiration breath pressure threshold. The frequency and/or duration of the
   provided oxygen enriched gas to the user relative to the current frequency and/or duration may be
   adjusted based on the change in the inspiration breath pressure threshold. Upon determining that
20 the inspiration breath pressure threshold has been lowered, the controller 400 may switch the
   oxygen concentrator to a sedentary mode. Controller 400 may switch the oxygen concentrator to
   an active mode, when the inspiration breath pressure threshold has been raised.
           In some embodiments, as seen in FIG. 9, the bolus of provided oxygen enriched gas may
   include two or more pulses. For example, with a one liter per minute (LPM) delivery rate, the
25 bolus may include two pulses: a first pulse 556 at approximately 7 cubic centimeters and a
   second pulse 558 at approximately 3 cubic centimeters. Other delivery rates, pulse sizes, and
   number of pulses are also contemplated.            For example, at 2 LPMs, the first pulse may be
   approximately 14 cubic centimeters and a second pulse may be approximately 6 cubic
   centimeters and at 3 LPMs, the first pulse may be approximately 21 cubic centimeters and a
30 second pulse may be approximately 9 cubic centimeters. In some embodiments, the larger pulse
   556 may be provided when the onset of inhalation is detected (e.g., detected by pressure sensor
   194). In some embodiments, the pulses may be provided when the onset of inhalation is detected
   and/or may be spread time-wise evenly through the breath. In some embodiments, the pulses
   may be stair-stepped through the duration of the breath. In some embodiments, the pulses may
                                                      Page 30

   be distributed in a different pattern. Additional pulses may also be used (e.g., 3, 4, 5, etc. pulses
   per breath). While the first pulse 556 is shown to be approximately twice the second pulse 558,
   in some embodiments, the second pulse 558 may be larger than the first pulse 556. In some
   embodiments, pulse size and length may be controlled by, for example, supply valve 160 which
 5 may open and close in a timed sequence to provide the pulses. A bolus with multiple pulses may
   have a smaller impact on a user than a bolus with a single pulse. The multiple pulses may also
   result in less drying of a user's nasal passages and less blood oxygen desaturation. The multiple
   pulses may also result in less oxygen waste.
            In some embodiments, the sensitivity of the oxygen concentrator 100 may be selectively
10 attenuated to reduce false inhalation detections due to movement of air from a different source
   (e.g., movement of ambient air).       For example, the oxygen concentrator 100 may have two
   selectable modes - an active mode and an inactive mode. In some embodiments, the user may
   manually select a mode (e.g., through a switch or user interface). In some embodiments, the
   mode may be automatically selected by the oxygen concentrator 100 based on a detected
15 breathing rate. For example, the oxygen concentrator 100 may use the pressure sensor 194 to
   detect a breathing rate of the user.      If the breathing rate is above a threshold, the oxygen
   concentrator 100 may operate in an active mode (otherwise, the oxygen concentrator may operate
   in an inactive mode). Other modes and thresholds are also contemplated.
            In some embodiments, in active mode, the sensitivity of the pressure sensor 194 may be
20 mechanically, electronically, or programmatically attenuated. For example, during active mode,
   controller 400 may look for a greater pressure difference to indicate the start of a user breath
   (e.g., an elevated threshold may be compared to the detected pressure difference to determine if
   the bolus of oxygen should be released). In some embodiments, the pressure sensor 194 may be
   mechanically altered to be less sensitive to pressure differences.     In some embodiments, an
25 electronic signal from the pressure sensor may be electronically altered to ignore small pressure
   differences. This can be useful when in active mode. In some embodiments, during the inactive
   mode the sensitivity of the pressure sensor may be increased. For example, the controller 400
   may look for a smaller pressure difference to indicate the start of a user breath (e.g., a smaller
   threshold may be compared to the detected pressure difference to determine if the bolus of
30 oxygen should be released). In some embodiments, with increased sensitivity, the response time
   for providing the bolus of oxygen during the user's inhalation may be reduced. The increased
   sensitivity and smaller response time may reduce the size of the bolus necessary for a given flow
   rate equivalence. The reduced bolus size may also reduce the size and power consumption of the
   oxygen concentrator 100.

   Providing a Bolus Based on Inhalation Profile
            In an embodiment, the bolus profile can be designed to match the profile of a particular
   user. To do so, an inhalation profile may be generated based on information gathered from
   pressure sensor 194 and flow rate sensor 185. An inhalation profile is assessed based on, one or
 5 more of the following parameters: the breathing rate of the user; the inhalation volume of the
   user; the exhalation volume of the user; the inhalation flow rate of the user; and the exhalation
   flow rate of the user. The breathing rate of the user may be assessed by detecting the onset of
   inhalation using pressure sensor 194 or flow rate sensor 185 as previously discussed. Inhalation
   volume may be assessed by measuring the change in pressure during inhalation and calculating
10 or empirically assessing the inhalation volume based on the change in pressure. Alternatively,
   inhalation volume may be assessed by measuring the flow rate during inhalation and calculating
   or empirically assessing the inhalation volume based on the flow rate and the length of the
   inhalation. Exhalation volume may be assessed in a similar manner using either positive pressure
   changes during exhalation, or flow rate and exhalation time. Inhalation flow rate of the user is
15 measured from shortly after the onset of inhalation. Detection of the end of inhalation may be
   from the pressure sensor or the flow rate sensor. When onset of inhalation is detected by the
   pressure sensor, the onset is characterized by a drop in pressure. When the pressure begins to
   increase, the inhalation is considered complete. When onset of inhalation is detected by the flow
   rate sensor, the onset is characterized by an increase in the flow rate. When the flow rate begins
20 to decrease, the inhalation is considered complete.
            There is a minimum amount of oxygen necessary for a person to remain conscious. A
   person who is breathing rapidly is bringing in a lower volume of air in each breath, and thus,
   requires less oxygen enriched gas per inhalation. While there is some variation from patient to
   patient, this relationship can be used to establish the mean flow rate for each breath
25 mathematically. By measuring a large population of patients, the profile of the relative flow
   from onset of inhalation to the onset of exhalation may be established. Using this flow profile as
   a template, the calculated actual flow based on breathing rate can be adjusted mathematically to a
   calculated actual flow profile. This profile can be used to adjust the opening and closing of the
   delivery valve to create an idealized profile for the patient based on their breathing rate.
30 Inhalation profile data gathered from a population of users may be used to create an algorithm
   that makes the appropriate adjustments based on the detected inhalation profile. Alternatively, a
   look up table may be used to control valve actuation durations and pulse quantities based on a
   detected inhalation profile.
                                                    Page 32

            Measuring the inhalation profile of the patient provides a more accurate basis for control
   of the bolus of oxygen enriched gas being provided to the patient. For example, basing the
   delivery of oxygen enriched gas on the onset of inhalation may not take into account differences
   between individual users. For example, people having a similar breathing rate can have different
 5 inhalation/exhalation volume, inhalation/exhalation flow rates and, thus, different bolus
   requirements necessary to produce the prescribed amount of oxygen. In one embodiment, an
   inhalation profile is created based on the flow rate of air during inhalation and the duration of
   inhalation. The inhalation profile can then be used as a predictor of the volume of air taken in by
   a specific user during inhalation. Thus, inhalation profile information can be used to modify the
10 amount of oxygen enriched air provided to the user to ensure that the prescribed level of oxygen
   is received. The amount of oxygen provided to a user may be adjusted by modifying the
   frequency and or duration of release of oxygen enriched gas from the accumulator with supply
   valve 160. By tracking the inhalation profile of the patient controller adjusts the delivery supply
   valve actuation to idealize the bolus profile to provide the oxygen at the maximum rate without
15 causing wasteful retrograde flow.

   15. The method of any one of claims 13-14, wherein adjusting an inspiration breath pressure
20 threshold of the pressure sensor based on the ratio comprises adjusting the inspiration breath
   pressure threshold to a lower inspiration threshold breath pressure relative to a current inspiration
   breath pressure threshold if the ratio is negative.
   16. The method of any one of claims 13-15, wherein adjusting an inspiration breath pressure
25 threshold of the pressure sensor based on the ratio comprises adjusting the inspiration breath
   pressure threshold to a higher inspiration threshold breath pressure relative to a current
   inspiration breath pressure threshold if the ratio is positive.
   17. An oxygen concentrator apparatus, comprising:
30
           a pressure sensor, the pressure sensor configured to detect a breath pressure of a user; and
                                                    Page 36

  a processor operable coupled to the pressure sensor, the processor to execute non
  transitory program instructions, and wherein the program instructions are operable to the
  method of any one of claims 1-16.
