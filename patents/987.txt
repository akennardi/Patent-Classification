                     CUTTING ASSEMBLY FOR A PLANT CUTTING MACHINE
                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    [0001]      The present invention relates generally to a cutting assembly for a header of
    a plant cutting machine (e.g., a combine harvester) and, more specifically, to a cutting
  5 assembly suitable for mounting proximate to a header using a pivot joint.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0002]      Cutting assemblies of large headers of plant cutting machines are typically
    driven either from near the center of the header or from an end of the header by an
    oscillating drive. Both a center driven and a side driven header have advantages and
 .0 disadvantages over the other.
    [0003]      In the case of a side driven header, i.e. a header having a driver located in
    one of the sides of the header, an advantageous aspect is that the driver does not
    obstruct or interfere with how plants are cut. However, a disadvantageous aspect is that
    the weight of the oscillating drive is concentrated at the end of the header. Because the
 .5 weight is distally concentrated, the structure of the header must be reinforced to
    properly accommodate this stress. Additionally, relatively long drive lines are generally
    required to establish a connection between the oscillating drive and the power source,
    such as a combine attached to the header, the connections of which are more
    proximate to the center of the header.
20  [0004]      While a center driven header may rectify some of the disadvantages of a side
    driven header such as the weight distribution, a more prevalent problem presents itself.
    Specifically, the use of a center driven header typically requires an assembly extending
    up above and connected to the cutter assemblies. Consequently, the space for
    collecting cut plants must also rise which creates inefficiencies, increases the moment
25  of forces and waste.
    [0005]      Additionally, a problem that exists between both a side driven and a center
    driven header is the connecting mechanism between the cutter assembly and the driver.
                                                   1

    As a plant cutting machine is operated, it travels over great distances on non-planar
    ground. Therefore, the connecting mechanism should preferably be able to
    accommodate the shift in ground level as the plant-cutting machine is operated,
    however, a rigid construction creates unnecessary stress on the assembly, thereby
  5 reducing its life expectancy and efficiency.
    [0006]     Accordingly, what is sought is a cutting assembly that is efficiently removable
    and is compatible with a drive mounted proximate the center of the header and that
    increases efficiency with space claims above the cutter assembly. When the disclosed
    invention is used in combination with such a drive, the invention overcomes one or more
 .0 of the disadvantages referenced above by providing more flexibility with space issues
    and connections at the cutter assembly to driver connection.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0007]     The present invention provides a cutting assembly capable of translating
    substantially straight line motion to a knife head that can be located either central to or
 .5 at a side of a header's cutter bar assembly.
    [0008]     In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
    header for a plant cutting machine that comprises a drive arm assembly and a knife
    head assembly. The drive arm assembly includes a drive member having a proximal
    end configured for attachment to a drive unit for reciprocating motion therewith and a
  o distal end opposite the proximal end. The drive arm assembly further includes a bearing
    element having a rounded head that is connectable to the distal end of the drive
    member. The knife head assembly includes a mounting bar and a clamping portion
    connectable to the mounting bar. The mounting bar and clamping portion collectively
    forming a cavity for receiving the rounded head of the bearing element.
25  [0009]     The reciprocating motion of the drive arm assembly drives substantially linear
    motion of the knife head assembly along a direction that is substantially parallel to a
    longitudinal length of the mounting bar. Another characteristic is that the rounded head
    is mounted within the cavity defining a pivot joint. In an alternate aspect, the bearing
                                                   2

    element includes a bearing surrounding the rounded head. Another aspect of the
    bearing element is that it includes a shaft that extends from the rounded head and
    which is connected to the drive member. Additionally, the shaft is integrally formed with
    the rounded head.
  5 [0010]     An aspect of the knife head assembly is that the clamping portion and
    mounting bar define an opening that substantially faces the distal end of the drive
    member and is in communication with the cavity for receiving the bearing element. It is
    preferred that the opening faces a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a
    longitudinal length of the mounting bar and substantially parallel to an upper surface of
 .0 the mounting bar. In an alternative aspect, the bearing element is integrally formed with
    the clamping portion.
    [0011]     Another aspect of the knife head assembly is that the clamping portion
    includes an inner concave bearing for engaging the rounded head. The mounting bar
    also includes a concave portion for receiving the rounded head. Additionally, the
 .5 clamping portion further includes a seal between the bearing element and the clamping
    portion.
    [0012]     In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is
    provided a drive arm assembly for a plant cutting machine that comprises a drive
    member and a bearing element. The drive member includes a proximal end configured
  o for attachment to a drive unit for reciprocating motion therewith and a distal end
    opposite the proximal end. The bearing element includes a rounded head for connecting
    to a knife head assembly and a shaft extending from the rounded head that is
    connectable to the distal end of the drive member.
    [0013]     The drive arm assembly can further comprise a seal that circumscribes the
25  bearing element. Additionally, the shaft can be integrally formed with the rounded head.
    The bearing element may further include a bearing surrounding the rounded head.
    [0014]     In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is a provided
    a knife head assembly for a plant cutting machine comprising a mounting bar and a
                                                   3

    clamping portion connectable to the mounting bar. The mounting bar and clamping
    portion collectively form a cavity for receiving a bearing element of a drive arm
    assembly.
    [0015]      The clamping portion can include an inner concave bearing. Additionally, the
  5 mounting bar can also include a concave portion for receiving the inner concave
    bearing. The clamping portion and mounting bar can define an opening in
    communication with the cavity for receiving the bearing element, wherein the opening
    faces a direction substantially transverse to a longitudinal length of the mounting bar.
    [0016]      Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
 .0 from the following, more detailed description of a non-limiting, exemplary embodiment,
    taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of
    example, the principles of the invention.

    [0036]       Furthermore, the described features, advantages and characteristics of the
    exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be combined in any suitable
25  manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, in
    light of the description herein, that the present invention can be practiced without one or
    more of the specific features or advantages of a particular exemplary embodiment. In
    other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain
                                                     6

    embodiments that may not be present in all exemplary embodiments of the present
    invention.
    [0037]     Referring now to the drawings, wherein aspects of the subject application are
    shown, FIGS. 1-13B illustrate an agricultural harvester 100 in accordance with an
  5 exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For exemplary purposes only, the
    agricultural harvester is illustrated as a combine harvester. The harvester 100 includes
    a header 102 having a first cutting assembly 200A and a second cutting assembly
    200B. The first and second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B are essentially identical, and
    therefore details hereto will be provided only as to one the first cutting assembly 200A
 .0 (hereto referred as "cutting assembly 200K). However, it is understood that the first and
    second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B need not be identical and that the second
    cutting assembly 200B can be arranged in ways commonly known in the art.
    [0038]     The cutting assembly 200A includes a drive arm assembly 900, a knife head
    assembly 1000, a first cutter bar 202A and a drive unit 400. The drive arm assembly
 .5 900 includes a drive member 500 and a bearing element 600. The drive member 500
    has a proximal end 502 configured for attachment to the drive unit 400 for reciprocating
    motion therewith and a distal end 504 opposite the proximal end 502. The bearing
    element 600 includes a rounded head 602 and is connectable to the distal end 504 of
    the drive member 500. The knife head assembly 1000 includes a mounting bar 700 and
 .0 a clamping portion 800. The clamping portion 800 is connectable to the mounting bar
    700 such that they collectively form a cavity 1002 for receiving the rounded head 602 of
    the bearing element 600.
    [0039]     Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, the header 102 is attached to a forward end
    of the harvester 100, which is configured to cut crops, including (without limitation) small
25  grains (e.g., wheat, soybeans, grain, etc.), and to induct the cut crops into a
    feederhouse 106 as the harvester moves forward over a crop field.
    [0040]     The header 102 includes a floor 104 that is supported in desired proximity to
    the surface of a crop field and the first and second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B that
    extend transversely along a forward edge of the floor 104 i.e., in a widthwise direction of
                                                   7

    the harvester. The first and second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B are configured to cut
    crops in preparation for induction into the feederhouse 106. Additionally, the header 102
    can include, for example, an elongate, transversely extending harvesting reel 108
    disposed above the first and second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B. The harvesting
  5 reel 108 is rotatable in a direction suitable for facilitating the induction of cut crops into
    the feederhouse 106. The header 102 can further include an elongate, rotatable auger
    which extends in close proximity to the first and second cutting assemblies 200A, 200B.
    The auger is configured to cooperate with the harvesting reel 108 in conveying cut
    crops to the feederhouse 106, which is configured to convey the cut crops into the
 .0 harvester 102 for threshing and cleaning. While the foregoing aspects of the harvester
    are being described with respect to the header shown, the cutting assembly of the
    subject application can be applied to any other header having use for such a cutting
    assembly.
    [0041]     The cutting assemblies 200A, 200B extend along a forward edge 110 of the
 .5 floor 104, and are generally bounded by a first side edge 112 and an opposing second
    side edge 114, both adjacent to the floor 104. The cutting assemblies 200A, 200B
    include the first cutter bar 202A and the second cutter bar 202B, respectfully. The first
    and second cutter bars 202A, 202B are movable and engage in reciprocating motion.
    The mechanisms of such cutter bars are known in the art and a typical cutter bar
 .0 applicable to the present exemplary embodiment is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
    8,151,547, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for all
    purposes.
    [0042]      Referring now to FIG. 4, the drive unit 400 includes a motor, such as an
    electric or hydraulically driven motor, to drive rotation of an output shaft 402 extending
25  outwardly from the drive unit 400. The output shaft 402 is configured as shown in FIG.
    4. Preferably, the output shaft 402 is cylindrical in shape and has ridges and channels
    circumscribing the output shaft 402. It is appreciated by those skilled in the art,
    however, that the output shaft 402 can take different shapes such as rectangular
    prisms. The mechanisms of such drive units are known in the art and a typical drive unit
                                                   8

    applicable to the present embodiment is disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2016/0073586, the
    entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.
    [0043]     Referring now to FIGS. 3-5 and 9, the drive member 500 is configured as
    shown. The drive member 500 has a proximal end 502 configured for attachment to the
  5 output shaft 402 by mechanisms well known in the art, one of which is discussed in
    greater detail below using brackets 506. The drive member 500 additionally has a distal
    end 504 opposite the proximal end 502. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
    the drive member 500 includes a gap 508 located substantially centrally to the body of
    the drive member 500 for connection with a connecting bracket 510. In the present
 .o embodiment, the drive member 500 has a trapezoidal shape having a shorter side near
    the distal end 504 and a longer side near the proximal end 502. The sides of the drive
    member 500 however do not need to be linear and are instead curved. The benefit of
    having curved sides is that they help conserve space limitations and minimize
    clearances between the components of the cutting assembly 200A and the header 102.
 .s [0044]     It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the shape of the drive member
    500 may vary and may instead be a different shape, such as a rectangle. Additionally, it
    is understood that the drive member 500 does not need to be planar and may include
    grooves or other features for engaging other elements or for the benefit of space claim
    concerns inside the header 102.
 .0 [0045]     Drive member 500 further includes a through-hole 512 extending from the
    distal end 504 towards the proximal end 502 in communication with the gap 508. The
    through-hole 512 extends through a distally facing side 514 of the drive member 500.
    The drive member 500 also has a pair of through-holes 516 extending from its distal
    end 504 to the proximal end 502 coinciding with a pair of screw-holes 404 on the
25  connecting bracket 510. In the preferred embodiment, the screw-holes 404 are threaded
    and the through-holes 516 are clearance holes configured to align with the screw-holes
    404 to create a screw connection. It is appreciated, however, that the connection can be
    configured in any other way known in the art, including, but not limited to, threading the
    through-holes 516 or making screw-holes 404 clearance-hole.
                                                   9

    [0046]     In the preferred exemplary embodiment, the through-hole 512 has a
    substantially consistent diameter, however, in an alternate embodiment the through
    hole 512 may be tapered such that the through-hole 512 has a smaller diameter closer
    to the proximal end 502 and a larger diameter closer to the distal end 504. Although the
  5 above through-holes 512, 516 are described with reference to diameters, it is
    understood that they are not limited as such; the through-holes 512, 516 may instead be
    different shapes such as, for example, squares.
    [0047]     The drive member 500 is configured to attach to one or more brackets 506,
    such as the connecting bracket 510. The connecting bracket 510 is configured as best
 .o shown in FIG. 4 and 5. Specifically, the connecting bracket 510 has an aperture 406
    designed to engage the output shaft 402. One such design could include ridges and
    channels circumscribing the inner surface of the aperture 406 that interconnect with the
    ridges and channels that circumscribe the output shaft 402. Additionally, the connecting
    bracket 510 could have a series of fasteners for engaging other components of the
 .5 header 102. The connecting bracket 510 also has the screw-holes 404 on its side
    closest to the drive member 500. In the exemplary embodiment, the screw-holes 404
    are threaded for a screw connection.
    [0048]     While the foregoing describes the drive member 500 and the connecting
    bracket 510 as separate pieces that connect the drive member 500 to the drive unit 400.
 .0 Alternatively, some or all of the bracketing components may be integrally formed
    together and/or with the drive member 500 for connecting to the output shaft 402.
    [0049]     Referring now to FIGS. 3, 4, 6 and 9, the bearing element 600 is configured
    as shown. The bearing element 600 includes a rounded head 602 and a shaft 604
    extending therefrom, or vice-versa. The rounded head 602 is designed to fit within a
25  cavity 1002, which is described in further detail below. The shaft 604 may be integrally
    formed with the rounded head 602 but can alternatively be removably connected by way
    of a fastener. In the exemplary embodiment, the shaft 604 further has a tapered end
    606 designed to fit through the through-hole 512 of the drive member 500. The
    remainder of the shaft 604 is designed to not fit through the through-hole 512. The
                                                 10

    tapered end 606 may also include threads such that a nut 408 can be used to secure
    the bearing element 600 to the drive member 500. Alternatively, the tapered end 606
    can include a through-hole 608 disposed to receive a dowel or screw to secure the shaft
    604 to the drive member 500.
  5 [0050]     In the preferred embodiment, the rounded head 602 also includes a bearing
    or outer layer 610 surrounding the rounded head 602. The bearing 610 may be a round
    roller bearing circumscribing the rounded head 602. Alternatively, the bearing 610 may
    instead be a layer of a flexible material, like a polymer such as an elastomer, for
    absorbing forces on the rounded head 602.
 .0 [0051]     With additional reference now to FIG. 11, the bearing element 600 can also
    include a seal, or cap, 1100 and/or a seal, or cap, 1102. The seals 1100, 1102 can be
    made out of metal or a polymer, such as an elastomer. The seal 1100 circumscribes the
    bearing element 600 and is designed to contact the knife head assembly 1000 in a
    sealing form to cover any gaps that may exist between the bearing element 600 and the
 .5 knife head assembly 1000. The seal 1100 is positioned between the bearing element
    600 and a clamping portion 800 of the knife head assembly 1000. In other words, the
    drive arm assembly 900 can further comprise a seal 1100 circumscribing the bearing
    element 600.
    [0052]     In an exemplary embodiment, the seal 1100 can be an elastomer ring with a
 .0 hole large enough for the shaft 604 of the bearing element 600 to fit through and slide
    onto the shaft 604 up to the rounded head 602. In accordance with another exemplary
    embodiment, the seal 1102 is removably affixed to the rounded head 602 at an end 612
    of the bearing element 600. In other words, seal 1102 can act like a cap for covering an
    opening 814 between the clamping portion 800 and the mounting bar 700.
25  [0053]     It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the bearing 610 and the seals
    1100, 1102 may be integrally formed with the design of the bearing element 600.
    However, it is also appreciated that the bearing 610 and the seals 1100, 1102 can
    instead be reconfigured to be separate components designed to engage the bearing
    element 600, mounting bar 700 or clamping portion 800. Alternatively, the bearing 610
                                                   11

    and the seals 1100, 1102 can instead be included with the mounting bar 700 and/or
    clamping portion 800, as described in further detail below.
    [0054]      Referring now to FIGS. 3, 4, 7 and 10 the mounting bar 700 is configured as
    shown. The mounting bar 700 has a longitudinal length extending parallel to the cutter
  5 bar 202A when assembled thereto, a concave portion 702, one or more apertures 704
    for receiving fasteners for connecting to a clamping portion 800 and one or more
    apertures 706 along the longitudinal length of the mounting bar 700 for fastening a
    cutter bar to the mounting bar 700. Additionally, the concave portion 702 may also
    include an aperture 708 for further securing the rounded head 602 within the cavity
 .0 1002. Alternatively, the aperture 708 may instead be replaced by any other suitable
    fastener, such as an adhesive surface. The concave portion 702 may additionally
    include a bearing surface or an otherwise modified surface for engaging the rounded
    head 602. Additionally, the mounting bar 700 may include features for engaging the
    seals 1100, 1102 such as grooves 1104 or clasps 1106.
 .5 [0055]      Referring now to FIG. 3, 4, 8 and 10, the clamping portion 800 is configured
    as shown. The clamping portion 800 has an outer surface 802 that is arcuate in shape
    with two ends 804, 806 and apertures 808. The clamping portion 800 further has a
    concave portion 810 that is also arcuate in shape between the two ends 804, 806 on an
    inside surface of the clamping portion 800. The concave portion 810 is designed to
 .0 receive the rounded head 602. The concave portion 810 is further configured to overlap
    and be in communication with the concave portion 702 of the mounting bar 700.
    Accordingly, when the clamping portion 800 and mounting bar 700 are secured
    together, they collectively form the cavity 1002. In other words, the rounded head 602 is
    mounted within the cavity 1002 defining a pivot joint. Additionally the apertures 808 at
25  the two ends 804, 806 are designed such that they overlap with the aperture 704 of the
    mounting bar 700.
    [0056]     While it is desired that the clamping portion 800 and concave portion 810 be
    arcuate in shape, the clamping portion 800 may be any other shape suitable with
    respect to space claims and limitations inside the header 102, such as a square,
                                                  12

    trapezoid, and so forth. However, it is appreciated that the design of the clamping
    portion 800 and concave portion 810 is such that it may efficiently be assembled with
    the mounting bar 700 and bearing element 600 and so that the bearing element 600 is
    securely held in place inside the cavity 1002.
  5 [0057]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the apertures 704, 706, 708,
    808 are through-holes configured to receive dowels by way of press fit for securing the
    bearing element 600, the mounting bar 700, the clamping portion 800 and the cutter bar
    202A together. However, instead of apertures and dowels alternative mechanisms for
    connecting two or more elements such as, for example, screws, bolts, rivets, and the
 .0 like may be used. Additionally, it is appreciated that the apertures 704, 706, 708 do not
    all have to be incorporated into the present invention and can be omitted if they are
    unnecessary, such as, for example, the aperture 708.
    [0058]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the concave portion 810 forms
    the opening 812 that faces the drive arm assembly 900 when assembled as shown in
 .5 FIG. 3. As shown additionally in FIG. 11, the clamping portion 800 has an opening 814
    facing away from the knife drive assembly 900 such that the rounded head 602 of the
    bearing element 600 can partially fit through, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Alternatively,
    as shown in FIG. 11, the opening 814 may instead be bounded by the seal 1102.
    [0059]      Additionally, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, the concave portion 810 may also
  o include an inner concave bearing 1108 for engaging the rounded head 602. The bearing
    1108 can be a roller bearing or an intermediate bearing layer. Circumscribing the
    bearing 1108 can be a bearing surface or housing 1110.
    [0060]      It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the drive member 500, bearing
    element 600, mounting bar 700 and clamping portion 800 may be integrally formed with
25  one another, and/or their individual components such as the rounded head 602, in
    several manners without departing form the scope of the present invention. For
    example, in one embodiment, the drive member 500 and bearing element 600 are
    integrally formed; in another embodiment, the bearing element 600 and clamping
    portion 800 are integrally formed; and in yet another embodiment the clamping portion
                                                   13

    800, the rounded head 602 and the mounting bar 700 are integrally formed, and so
    forth.
    [0061]     With reference now to FIGS. 1-4, 9 and 10, there is illustrated an assembled
    drive arm assembly 900 and knife head assembly 1000 inside the header 102 in
  5 accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
    [0062]     The cutting assembly 200A includes a cutter bar 202A connected to the knife
    head assembly 1000 which is connected to the drive arm assembly 900 driven by the
    drive unit 400. For convenience purposes only, references will be made only with
    respect to the first cutting assembly 200A for describing the connections in more detail
 .0 below, and not the second cutting assembly 200B. It is understood, however, that the
    second cutting assembly 200B is similarly connected as the first cutting assembly 200A.
    [0063]     With respect to the drive arm assembly 900, the drive unit 400 is operatively
    connected to the output shaft 402. The output shaft 402 is connected to the drive
    member 500, by, for example, extending through the aperture 406 of the connecting
 .5 bracket 510 attached to the drive member 500 and by interconnecting the ridges and
    channels circumscribing the output shaft 402 and the inner surface of the aperture 406.
    [0064]     In the exemplary embodiment, the bearing element 600 is connected at its
    shaft 604 to the distal end 504 of the drive member 500. In other words, the bearing
    element 600 includes a shaft 604 extending from the rounded head 602 and connected
 .0 to the drive member 500. The connection is made via a through-hole 512 extending
    through the distal end 504 at its distally facing side 514. It can be appreciated that there
    are other connection methods available such as, but not limited to, welding or integrally
    forming the drive member 500 to the bearing element 600. The tapered end 606
    extends through through-hole 512 and exits near the proximal end 502 into the gap 508.
25  Because the bearing element 600 has a tapered end 606, the entire longitudinal length
    of the bearing element 600 cannot fit through the through-hole 512. The bearing
    element 600 is then fastened at the drive member 500 by means of, for example, a nut
    and bolt 408 on the tapered end 606 and/or a dowel force-fit into the through-hole 608.
                                                   14

    [0065]     The through-hole 512 is located on a distally facing side 514 of the drive
    member 500 such that when the bearing element 600 is secured to the drive member
    500, the bearing element 600 extends out of the drive member 500 in cantilever relation
    to the knife head assembly 1000.
  5 [0066]     With respect to the knife head assembly 1000, the rounded head 602 is
    positioned over the concave portion 702 of the mounting bar 700. The clamping portion
    800 is fastened over the rounded head 602 to the mounting bar 700 such that the two
    form a cavity 1002 for the rounded head 602 to be secured in. The clamping portion 800
    is then secured to the mounting bar 700, e.g., by way of dowels extending through the
 .0 apertures 704, 808, such as those shown in FIG. 12. Use of dowels provide the ease of
    assembling and disassembling the knife head assembly 1000. However, it is
    appreciated by those skilled in the art that the connection may be accomplished in any
    number of ways including, but not limited to, screws, welding, hooks, clasps, grooves,
    rivets and receiving holes and so forth.
 .5 [0067]     Referring to FIG. 2, the first cutter bar 202A is attached to the mounting bar
    700, e.g., nuts and bolts through the apertures 706. It is to be appreciated that there is
    no rigid requirement concerning the number of apertures or fasteners. The foregoing
    exemplary embodiment may be practiced with any number of connection methods and
    connection points.
 0  [0068]     It can be thus understood by those skilled in the art that the bearing element
    600 extends through the opening 812 between the mounting bar 700 and the clamping
    portion 800. It is appreciated then that while the cavity 1002 is large enough to receive
    and cradle the rounded head 602, the opening 812 is smaller than the rounded head
    602 but larger than the shaft 604 of the bearing element 600. Consequently, the bearing
25  element 600 is held in place collectively by the clamping portion 800 and mounting bar
    700. While the shaft 604 can be integrally formed with the rounded head 602, it can be
    appreciated that in an alternate embodiment, the shaft can 604 can be a separate piece
    to be removably attached to the rounded head 602 by way of, for example, a screw and
    thread connection.
                                                   15

    [0069]     An additional aspect of this exemplary embodiment is that the mounting bar
    700 and the clamping portion 800, with the cavity 1002 and the opening 812, securely
    fasten the bearing element 600 such that the movement of the bearing element 600 is
    minimized. However, while bearing element 600 is secured, it is permitted marginal, if
  5 any, motion between the rounded head 602 and the bearings around it, such as the
    bearing 610, bearing 1108 and bearing surface 1110 or any combination thereof.
    [0070]     In an exemplary aspect, the clamping portion 800 is mounted to an upper
    surface of the mounting bar 700 and the bearing element 600 protrudes out of the cavity
    1002 in cantilever relation to the drive arm assembly 900 such that the opening 812
 .0 faces the drive member 500. In other words, the clamping portion 800 and the
    mounting bar 700 define an opening 812 facing the distal end 504 of the drive member
    500 in communication with the cavity 1002 for receiving the bearing element 600 and
    the opening 812 faces the a direction substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal length
    of the mounting bar 700 and substantially parallel to an upper surface of the mounting
 .5 bar 700. Put differently, the clamping portion 800 and the mounting bar 700 define an
    opening 812 in communication with the cavity 1002 for receiving the bearing element
    600, and the opening 514 faces a direction substantially transverse to a longitudinal
    length of the mounting bar 700.
    [0071]     Referring now to FIGS. 13A and 13B, in the exemplary embodiment, the
 .0 present invention operates by causing reciprocating motion of the mounting bar 700 and
    consequently the first cutter bar 202A. As the drive unit 400 is engaged in reciprocating
    rotational motion, the rotational motion of the drive unit 400 is transferred to the output
    shaft 402 which begins to rotate in reciprocating fashion. As the output shaft 402
    rotates, the connecting bracket 510, which is secured to the output shaft 402, transfers
25  the rotational motion to the drive member 500 and the drive member 500 arcs in a
    reciprocating longitudinal direction.
    [0072]     As the drive member 500 engages in reciprocating arcing motion, the bearing
    element 600 that extends in cantilever relation from the drive member 500 arcs with it.
    Because the bearing element 600 is held by the cavity 1002 in a ball and socket joint
                                                  16

    like manner, the bearing element 600 pivots within the cavity 1002, or more specifically
    between the bearings inside the cavity 1002 either around the bearing element 600 or a
    part of the clamping portion 800 and/or the mounting bar 700. As the bearing element
    600 pivots, the bearing element 600 transfers the reciprocating motion to the knife head
  5 assembly 1000. Consequently, the knife head assembly 1000 engages in reciprocating
    linear motion generally in a longitudinal direction.
    [0073]     As shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, the bearing element 600 pivots while it is
    inside the cavity 1002. This is accomplished by orientating the opening 812 to face the
    distal end 504 of the drive member 500 in a horizontal orientation, such that the bearing
 .0 element 600 connects the drive member 500 to the knife head assembly 1000 in
    cantilever relation. The bearing element 600 is also oriented above and perpendicular to
    the mounting bar 700 without extending through the mounting bar 700. Further, the
    opening 812 faces a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal length
    of the mounting bar 700 and substantially parallel to an upper surface of the mounting
 .5 bar 700. Therefore, the reciprocating motion of the drive arm assembly 900 drives
    substantially linear motion of the knife head assembly 1000 along a direction
    [0074]      It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that linear motion can be reinforced
    with the addition of linear bearings on the cutter bar 202A or the mounting bar 700. The
    benefit of having a pivot joint with varying degrees of freedom is that it is not restricted
 .0 from accommodating unforeseen and unexpected forces. For example, as an
    agricultural combine travels over an uneven field, there will be forces pushing up and
    down against the cutter bar at some spots but not others. A rigid joint would face those
    forces and fail much quicker than a pivot joint that can accommodate such forces by
    pivoting in the appropriate direction. Thus, the cutting assemblies 200A will have
25  improved life expectancy and operate more efficiently with less mechanical failure
    issues than a typical cutter assembly.
    [0075]     Additionally, it can also be appreciated that the present invention is
    configured such that the assembly tolerances between the various components do not
    have to be so small as to inhibit construction if the components are not perfectly
                                                   17

    manufactured. For example, the spherical or arced shape of the rounded head 602
    and/or the concave portion 810 of the clamping portion 800, by nature of their spherical
    shape, can have a significant dimensional variance and still operate as desired.
    [0076]       During reciprocating motion, because forces will be on the bearing element
  5 600, it is likely that the bearing element 600 may fail at some point. Thus, it is desirable
    that the bearing element 600 be easily replaceable. In the present invention, the cutter
    bar 202A can be removed from knife head assembly 1000 by releasing the fasteners
    from the apertures 706. Then the mounting bar 700 and the clamping portion 800 can
    be separated by removing the dowels from the clamping portion's 800 and mounting
 .0 bar's 700 respective apertures 808, 708. The bearing element 600 can then be removed
    from the drive member 500 by releasing the nut 408 and sliding the tapered end 606 out
    of through-hole 512. Thereafter, the bearing element 600 can be easily replaced and
    the drive arm assembly 900 and the knife head assembly 1000 can be put back
    together.
 .5 [0077]       While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary
    embodiments, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes may
    be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing
    from the scope of the present invention. For example, features described in one
    embodiment may be incorporated into a different embodiment, such as the use of
 .0 bearings around the bearing element and/or inside the cavity. Additionally, features
    described in one manner may instead be accomplished by known techniques in the art,
    such as the methods of making a pivotable connection.
    [0078]       In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or
    material to the teachings of the present invention without departing from the essential
25  scope thereof. For example, the headers and knife drives may only utilize a single cutter
    blade or two or more cutter blades, or be located centrally to the header or on the side
    of the header, the bearing element, clamping portion, drive member, and mounting bar
    may be non-uniformly shaped or be non-planar. It is to be understood, therefore, that
    the present invention not be limited to the particular aspects disclosed, but it is intended
                                                  18

to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by
the appended claims.
