   Detailed Description
 5
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   wherein the spin direction of at least one of the reels
   can be arranged to a diagonal direction. In some
10 embodiments, both diagonal and vertical spins can occur.
   The gaming system may take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
15 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
20 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
25 such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
30 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
35 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.        For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
                                          7681680_1  (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                              - 10
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
 5 several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
10 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
15 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 that includes one or more input devices which
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place bets),  and one or more speakers 58.
20
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
25 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
30 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
35 machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
                                           7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                              -  11
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
 5 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
   reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
   reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
10 loyalty program.   The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
15 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.           Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
20 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
25 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
30 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
35
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
                                            7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                             - 12
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
 5
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
10 machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
15 random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
20 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader
   108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
   mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.            Additional
25 hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine
   100, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation. For example, while buttons or
   touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
   allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
30 game any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
35 The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.

                             - 13
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
 5 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
10 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
15 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
20 alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
25 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
30 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
35 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
 5 the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
10 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.        A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
15 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
20 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
25 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
30 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
35
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
 5 plurality of different computers.  For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random number generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
10 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
15
   Embodiments of the invention relate to gaming systems for
   implementing games that involve a display of spinning
   reels as part of the display of the outcome of the game.
   The game controllers of such gaming systems have a stop
20 determining function that accesses a random number
   generator to determine the stop position for each reel.
   For example, if there are five reels, each having twenty
   symbols, the stop determining function might determine
   that the stop positions correspond to the symbols at
25 positions 3, 13, 7, 9 and 17 of their respective reel. The
   spinning of the reels is then controlled so that each
   selected symbol comes to a stop at a designated place. The
   symbols shown at other display positions of each reel are
   automatically selected because they are on the same reel
30 strip such that neighbouring symbols will be shown at the
   other display positions.
   Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to
   gaming systems that allow a player to select how many win
35 lines of a plurality of win lines they will play in each
   game - i.e. a minimum of one win line up to the maximum
   number of win lines allowed by the game. Each win line is
   formed by a set of symbol positions consisting of one
   symbol position from each reel. That is, a designated
                                          7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                             - 16
   symbol position of each reel is assigned to a win line.
   The symbol positions that constitute each of the win lines
   are usually advertised to the player by markings on the
   display or diagrams showing the symbol positions that
 5 correspond to each win line. The win lines may incorporate
   for example, horizontal or incorporate diagonal line
   portions.
   Diagonal win line portions admit the possibility that in a
10 diagonal spin game round of the present invention, the win
   line can include all of the visible reel positions of a
   single reel, allowing for different win probabilities
   especially when the reel has a "stacked symbol"            (i.e. a
   repeated set of the same symbol in adjacent positions on
15 the reel). Diagonal win lines also allow for different
   interactions between the symbols of the reels and the win
   lines. Embodiments exploiting these possibilities are
   described in more detail below.
20 The game controller of one embodiment is shown in more
   detail in Figure 6. The game controller 60 incorporates a
   processor 62 which implements a symbol selector 610,
   random number generator 650, spin direction controller 620
   comprising vertical spin controller 621 and diagonal spin
25 controller 622, and outcome generator 630 based on program
   code stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that one or more of these components could be
   provided in other ways, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
30
   Symbol selector 610 selects symbols from symbol data 641
   using random numbers from random number generator 650, to
   appear at display positions on the display 54. For
   example, by selecting stop positions for a plurality of
35 reels defined by symbol data 641 as described above.
   Symbol selector 610 works in cooperation with spin
   direction controller 620 which controls the correspondence
   between the reels and the display positions. In one
   embodiment the game round may be a conventional vertical
                                          7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                             - 17
   spin game round or a diagonal spin game round, as
   determined in response to a trigger event which may be for
   example, a player input from game play mechanism 56                (for
   example, a specific bet type such as an ante bet),              by a
 5 random event obtained either directly from random number
   generator 650, or by a previous game round outcome such as
   a special prize determined by outcome generator 630 or a
   specific combination of symbols. In a vertical spin game
   round as is conventionally played, vertical spin
10 controller 621 informs symbol selector 610 that the
   visible reel positions are to correspond vertically with
   the reels. In a diagonal spin game round, diagonal spin
   controller 622 informs symbol selector 610 of a different
   correspondence where at least one of the reels has the
15 visible reel positions disposed diagonally across the
   display positions. Which particular reel or reels are
   modified may be predetermined or controlled by player
   choice, random event or previous game outcome. Spin
   direction controller 620 and in particular diagonal spin
20 controller 622 also communicates with outcome generator
   630 to determine whether any win lines should be adjusted.
   The outcome generator 630 calculates any prize associated
   with the current game round depending on game instructions
25 644, prize data 645 and any modifications to win lines
   dictated by diagonal spin controller 622. The outcome
   generator then updates meter data 645, and displays any
   win on display 54 on the player interface 50.
30 Now referring to Figure 7, a flow diagram for an
   embodiment of the invention is shown. The step of
   determining whether the reels should spin diagonally 1201
   is first performed, with input from player choice, random
   event or previous win combination. If the answer is "no",
35 the vertical spin controller 621 informs symbols selector
   610 of a particular correspondence between the display
   positions and the reels as well as which reels are to spin
   so that the reels will spin vertically. Any win line which
   has been adjusted in a previous diagonal spin game round
                                          7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                             - 18
   is reset to its previous position. If the answer is "yes",
   in step 1202 the diagonal spin controller 622 informs
   symbol selector 610 of a particular correspondence between
   the display positions and the reels as well as which reels
 5 are to spin so that at least one of the reels will spin
   diagonally. In one embodiment, the visible reel positions
   of at least one of the reels is moved into a corner to
   accommodate other reels with diagonal spins, the former
   reel being frozen for the diagonal spin. In a variant of
10 this embodiment, the reels spins but the reel is non
   linear in the sense that the three display positions which
   correspond to the reel do not follow a straight line but
   these reels are still spun.
15 In step 1203 the diagonal spin controller determines from
   player choice, random event or previous win combination
   whether the win lines are to be adjusted. If the answer is
   "no", the win lines remain as the same set of display
   positions set during a conventional vertical spin game
20 round. If the answer is "yes", the win lines are adjusted
   in step 1204. In one example, if a win line contained a
   diagonal element that would have allowed all the visible
   reel positions of a single reel to fall on the win line,
   the win line is rearranged to avoid such coincidence, for
25 example, a different set of win lines may apply in
   diagonal spin rounds to vertical spin rounds. In another
   embodiment, the win lines may remain the same, for example
   so that a player may obtain additional benefits from
   stacked symbols on a reel. Accordingly, in one example, a
30 first award made to a player is to award stacked symbols
   and a second award is to conduct one or more diagonal spin
   rounds.
   In step 1206 the symbol selector 610 is cleared to spin
35 the reels, using random number generator 650 and symbol
   data 641, and the result is displayed on display 54.
   In step 1207 outcome generator 630 determines the game
   round outcome from prize data 645 using win lines as
                                          7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                              - 19
   possibly modified by the spin direction controller 620.
   It will be appreciated that the invention is not
   restricted to a particular direction of diagonal shift or
 5 a particular number of affected reels. It will also be
   appreciated that an alternative to rearranging the non
   participating reels into corners is to overwrite those
   positions and even leave some positions blank or with
   special symbols. It will further be appreciated that the
10 non-diagonal and non-vertical reels could also be "spun"
   in their crooked-leg orientations. It will also be
   appreciated that in one extreme, all of the game rounds
   can be diagonal spin game rounds.
15 Example 1
   Now referring to Figures 8A, 8B and 8C, an example of one
   embodiment of the method of the invention is shown. In
   Figure 8A the display is divided after a vertical spin
20 game round into five reels 840a to 840e numbered 1 to 5
   from left to right each displaying three symbols in a
   vertical visible reel window, arranged into top line 850a,
   centre line 850b and bottom line 850c such that there are
   15 display positions in total. The spin directions in the
25 vertical spin round were as specified by the five vertical
   arrows X.   Triggered by a random event, the spin direction
   controller determines that a diagonal spin game round will
   now occur. The central three reels, numbers 2, 3 and 4,
   will be shifted to diagonal spins as indicated by arrows Y
30 and are individually shaded in the diagram. In figure 8B
   the result of the rearrangement is seen, where reels 2, 3
   and 4 are shifted horizontally one position left on the
   top line and horizontally one position right on the bottom
   line. Reel 1 is rearranged to occupy the three positions
35 in the bottom left and reel 5 is rearranged to occupy the
   three positions in the top right. In Figure 8C the result
   of the diagonal spin game round is shown. In this example,
   Reel 1 and reel 5 did not spin, being neither diagonal nor
   vertical.  (In other embodiments they can spin with the
                                           7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                             - 20
   display positions having a designated relationship such
   that the symbol order on the reel is preserved relative to
   the display positions.) Reels 2, 3 and 4 have spun
   diagonally. Reel 2 shows three Kings in its three display
 5 positions, having a "stacked symbol".
   The prize is now evaluated by outcome generator 630. The
   win line in this example was the default centre line,
   which was not changed by diagonal spin controller 622.
10 There are no prizes awarded, so meter data 646 is not
   updated.
   Example 2
15 Now referring to Figure 9, another example is shown as a
   variant on the play of example 1. The play is the same as
   in example 1, except that in this example the win line has
   been set as the zigzag line shown. Diagonal spin
   controller 622 has determined that the zigzag line is not
20 to be adjusted for the diagonal spin game round. The win
   line passes through all of the visible reel positions of
   reel 2. Since Reel 2 has a stacked symbol, the consequence
   is that the win line picks up all the three Kings. The
   prize is now evaluated by outcome generator 630 and the
25 player is paid for four Kings on the win line.
   Example 3
   Now referring to Figure 10, another example is shown as a
30 further variant on the play of example 1. Starting from
   the same configuration of symbols show in Figure 8A,
   diagonal spin controller 622 triggered by a random event
   has determined that reel 2 will be rearranged to a
   diagonal position. Reels 1 and 3 are shifted as shown to
35 make way. Reels 4 and 5 are unaffected and will spin
   vertically. Thus in this example, reel 2 will spin
   diagonally, reels 4 and 5 will spin vertically and reels 1
   and 3 will be frozen.
                                          7681680_1 (GHKatters) P75995.AU.4 2/05/18

                              - 21
   Example 4
   Now referring to Figures 11A and 11B, there is shown a
 5 further example where Reel 2 has stacked symbols in the
   form of a lot of wild symbols but could also be composed
   solely of wild symbols. In Figure 11A there are 3 played
   win lines corresponding to the rows of display positions.
   In Figure 11A there are now winning symbol combinations.
10
   A diagonal spin is triggered and the reels are rearranged
   such that Reel 1 1110 occupies the bottom left display
   positions, Reels 2,3, and 4 1120,1130,1140 occupy diagonal
   lines of display positions and Reel 5 1150 occupies the
15 top right display positions. The reels have each been re
   spun as shown in Figure 11B such that there is a winning
   combination of wild, Q,Q on the top line paying 3 queens
   and a winning combination of A, wild, A paying 3 Aces on
   the centre line.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the method
   of the embodiment could be embodied in program code. The
   program code could be supplied in a number of ways, for
   example on a computer readable medium, such as a disc or a
25 memory  (for example, that could replace part of memory
   103) or as a data signal  (for example, by transmitting it
   from a server).
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that many
30 variations may be made to the invention without departing
   from the scope of the invention.
