                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002] Potassium (K) is the most abundant intracellular cation, comprising ~ 35
10 40mEq/kg in humans. See Agarwal, R, et al. (1994) Gastroenterology 107: 548-571;
   Mandal, AK (1997) Med Clin North Am 81: 611-639. Only 1.5-2.5% of this is
   extracellular. Potassium is obtained through the diet, mainly through vegetables,
   fruits, meats and dairy products, with certain food such as potatoes, beans, bananas,
   beef and turkey being especially rich in this element. See Hunt, CD and Meacham,
15 SL (2001) J Am Diet Assoc 101: 1058-1060; Hazell, T (1985) World Rev Nutr Diet
   46: 1-123. In the US, intake is -80mEq/day. About 80% of this intake is absorbed
   from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the urine, with the balance excreted in
   sweat and feces. Thus, potassium homeostasis is maintained predominantly through
   the regulation of renal excretion. Where renal excretion of K* is impaired, elevated
20 serum K* levels will occur. Hyperkalemia is a condition wherein serum potassium is
   greater than about 5.0 mEq/L.
   [0003] While mild hyperkalemia, defined as serum potassium of about 5.0-6mEq/L,
   is not normally life threatening, moderate to severe hyperkalemia (with serum
   potassium greater than about 6.1 mEq/L) can have grave consequences. Cardiac
25 arrythmias and altered ECG waveforms are diagnostic of hyperkalemia. See
   Schwartz, MW (1987) Am I Nurs 87: 1292-1299. When serum potassium levels
   increases above about 9mEq/L, atrioventricular dissociation, ventricular tachycardia,
   or ventricular fibrillation can occur.
   [0004] Hyperkalemia is rare in the general population of healthy individuals.
30 However, certain groups definitely exhibit a higher incidence of hyperkalemia. In
   patients who are hospitalized, the incidence of hyperkalemia ranges from about 1
    10%, depending on the definition of hyperkalemia. Patients at the extremes of life,

    WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   either premature or elderly, are at high risk. The presence of decreased renal function,
   genitourinary disease, cancer, severe diabetes, and polypharmacy can also predispose
   patients to hyperkalemia.
   [00051 Most of the current treatment options for hyperkalemia are limited to use in
 5 hospitals. For example, exchange resins, such as Kayexalate, are not suitable for
   outpatient or chronic treatment, due to the large doses necessary that leads to very low
   patient compliance, severe GI side effects and significant introduction of sodium
   (potentially causing hypernatremia and related fluid retention and hypertension).
   Diuretics that can remove sodium and potassium from patients via the kidneys are
10 often limited in their efficacy due to underlying kidney disease and frequently related
   diuretic resistance. Diuretics are also contraindicated in patients where a drop in
   blood pressure and volume depletion are undesired (e.g. CHF patients that in addition
   to offering from low blood pressure are often on a combination of drugs such as
   ACE inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone that can induce
15 hyperkalemia).
    (00061 Overall, it would be desirable to obtain higher binding capacity materials for
   the treatment ofhyperkalemia, such materials preferably having a greater binding in
   the physiological pH range for potassium, which are also non-degradable, non
    absorbable and have decreased toxic effects.
20                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [00071 The present invention provides compositions and methods for the removal of
    potassium ions from the gastro-intestinal tract. In one embodiment, an effective
    amount of a potassium binding polymer is administered to an animal subject, such as
    a human, the polymer being capable of binding and removing an average of 1.5 mmol

                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    [0029] The present invention provides methods, polymeric pharmaceutical
    compositions, and kits for the treatment of animal subjects. The terms "animal
                                                A

     WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   subject" and "animal" as used herein includes humans as well as other mammals. In
   particular, the present invention provides polymeric compositions for the removal of
   potassium ions. Preferably, these compositions are used for the removal of potassium
   ions from the gastrointestinal tract of animal subjects.
 5 [0030] One aspect of the invention is a method of removing potassium ions with a
   potassium-binding polymeric composition. In one embodiment, the potassium
   binding polymeric composition has high capacity and/or selectivity for binding
   potassium and does not significantly release the bound potassium in the
   gastrointestinal tract. It is preferred that the polymeric composition exhibit selective
10 binding for potassium ions.
   [0031] It is preferred that the polymeric compositions of the present invention exhibit
   high capacity and/or selectivity for potassium ions. The term "high capacity" as used
   herein encompasses an average in vivo binding of about 1.5 mmol or more of
   potassium per gin of polymer. Typically, this in vivo binding capacity is determined
15 in a human. Techniques for determining in vivo potassium binding capacity in a
   human are well known in the art. For example, following administration of a
   potassium-binding polymer to a patient, the amount of potassium in the feces can be
   used to calculate the in vivo potassium binding capacity. The average in vivo binding
   is preferably calculated in a set of normal human subjects, this set being about 5
20 human subjects, preferably about 10 human subjects, even more preferably about 25
   human subjects, and most preferably about 50 human subjects.
    [0032] In some embodiments, the average in vivo potassium binding capacity can be
   equal to or more than about 1.5 mmnol per gm of polymer in a human. Preferably the
   in vivo potassium binding capacity in a human is about 2 mmol or more per gm, more
25 preferred is about 3 mmol or more per gm even more preferred is about 4 mmol or
   more per gM, and most preferred is about 6 mmol or more per gm. In a preferred
   embodiment, the average in vivo potassium binding capacity in a human is about 2
   mmol to about 6 mmol per gm in a human.
    [00331 The capacity of the potassium binding polymers can also be determined in
30 vitro. It is preferred that the in vitro potassium binding capacity is determined in
   conditions that mimic the physiological conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract, in
   particular the colon. In some embodiments, the in vitro potassium binding capacity is
   determined in solutions with a pH of about 5.5 or more. In various embodiments, in
   vitro potassium binding capacity in a pH of about 5.5 or more is equal to or more than
                                                  5

    WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   6 mmol per gmn of polymer. A preferred range of in vitro potassium binding capacity
   in a pH of about 5.5 or more is about 6 mmol to about 12 mmol per gin of polymer.
   Preferably the in vitro potassium binding capacity in a pH of about 5.5 or more is
   equal to about 6 mmol or more per gm, more preferred is about 8 mmol or more per
 5 gin, even more preferred is about 10 mmol or more per gm, and most preferred is
   about 12 mmol or more per gm.
   10034 The higher capacity of the polymeric composition enables the administration
   of a lower dose of the composition. Typically the dose of the polymeric composition
   used to obtain the desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefits is about 0.5 gm/day
10 to about 25 gm/day. Most preferred is about 15 gm/day or less. A preferred dose
   range is about 5 gm/day to about 20 gm/day, more preferred is about 5 gm/day to
   about 15 gm/day, even more preferred is about 10 gm/day to about 20 gm/day, and
   most preferred is about 10 gm/day to about 15 gm/day. Preferably the dose is
   administered about three times a day with meals, most preferably the dose is
15 administered once a day.
   [0035] It is also preferred that the compositions described herein retain a significant
   amount of the bound potassium. Preferably, the potassium is bound by the polymer in
   the colon and not released prior to excretion of the polymer in the feces. The term
   "significant amount" as used herein is not intended to mean that the entire amount of
20 the bound potassium is retained. It is preferred that at least some of the bound
   potassium is retained, such that a therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit is obtained.
   Preferred amounts of bound potassium that can be retained range from about 5% to
   about 100%. It is preferred that the polymeric compositions retain about 25% of the
   bound potassium, more preferred is about 50%, even more preferred is about 75% and
25 most preferred is retention of about 100% of the bound potassium. The period of
   retention is preferred to be during the time that the composition is being used
   therapeutically and/or prophylactically. In the embodiment in which the composition
   is used to bind and remove potassium from the gastrointestinal tract, the retention
   period is the time of residence of the composition in the gastro-intestinal tract and
30 more particularly the average residence time in the colon.
   100361 Preferably the potassium binding polymers are not absorbed from the gastro
   intestinal tract. The term "non-absorbed" and its.grammatical equivalents is not
   intended to mean that the entire amount of administered polymer is not absorbed. It is
   expected that certain amounts of the polymer may be absorbed. It is preferred that
                                               6

   WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
    about 90% or more of the polymer is not absorbed, preferably about 95% or more is
    not absorbed, even more preferably about 97% or more is not absorbed, and most
   preferably about 98% or more of the polymer is not absorbed.
    Potassium-Binding Polymers
 5  [0037] In some embodiments, the potassium-binding polymers comprise acid groups
    in their protonated or ionized form, such as sulfonic (-SO)), sulfuric (-OS03),
    carboxylic (-C02), phosphonic (-P0)3, phosphoric (-(OPO3), or sulfamate (
   NHSO). Preferably, the fraction of ionization of the acid groups is greater than
    about 75% at the physiological pH in the colon and the potassium binding capacity is
10  greater than about 5 mmol/gm. Preferably the ionization of the acid groups is greater
   than about 80%, more preferably it is greater than about 90%, and most preferably it
   is about 100%. In certain embodiments the acid containing polymers contain more
   than one type of acid groups. In certain embodiments the acid containing polymers
    are administered in their anhydride form and generate the ionized form when
15 contacted with physiological fluids.
    f0038] In some other embodiments, a pJ-decreasing group, preferably an electron
   withdrawing substituent, is located adjacent to the acid group, preferably it is located
   in the alpha or beta position of the acid group. The preferred electron-withdrawing
   substituents are a hydroxyl group, an ether group, an ester group, or an halide atom,
20 and most preferably F. Preferred acid groups are sulfonic (-03), sulfuric (-OS03),
   carboxylic (-CO), phosphonic (-P0      3 ), phosphoric (-(OPOf), or sulfamate (
   NHS0    3 ). Other preferred polymers result from the polymerization   of alpha-fluoro
   acrylic acid, difluoromaleic acid, or an anhydride thereof.

   [0042] Sulfamic (i.e. when Z=SO3H) or phosphoramidic (i.e. when Z= P03H) polymers can
   be obtained from amine polymers or monomer precursors treated with a sulfonating agent
   such as sulfur trioxide/amine adducts or a phosphonating agent such as P205, respectively.
   Typically, the acidic protons of phosphonic groups are exchangeable with cations, like
 5 sodium or potassium, at pH of about 6 to about 7.
   [00431 Free    radical   polymers     derived   from   monomers   such   as   vinyl    sulfonate,
   vinylphosphonate, or vinylsulfamate can also be used.
   100441 Preferred monomers for use herein are a-fluoroacrylate and difluoromaleic acid, a
   fluoroacrylate being most preferred. This monomer can be prepared from a variety of routes,
10 see for example, Gassen et al, J. Fluorine Chemistry, 55, (1991) 149-162, KF Pittman, C. U.,
   M. Ueda, et al. (1980). Macromolecules 13(5): 1031-1036. Difluoromaleic acid is preferred
   by oxidation of fluoroaromatic compounds (Bogachev et al, Zhurnal Organisheskoi Khimii,
   1986, 22(12), 2578-83), or fluorinated furans derivatives (See U.S. patent 5,112,993).         A
   preferred mode of synthesis of a-fluoroacrylate is given in EP 415214.
15 [00451 Other methods comprise the step-growth polymerization from phosphonate,
   carboxylic, phosphate, sulfinate, sulfate and sulfonate functionals compounds. High density
   polyphosphonates such as Briquest, marketed by Rhodia, are particularly useful.
   [0046] The polymers of the invention also include ion exchange resins synthesized from
   naturally occurring polymers, such as saccharine polymers and semi-synthetic polymers,
20 optionally functionalized to create ion exchange sites on the backbone or on the pendant
   residues. Examples of polysaccharides of interest include materials from vegetal or animal
   origins, such as cellulosic materials, hemicellulose, alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl cellulose,
   carboxymethylcellulose,      sulfoethylcellulose,  starch, xylan, amylopectine,     chondroitin,
   hyarulonate, heparin, guar, xanthan, mannan, galactomannan, chitin and chitosan.            Most
25 preferred are polymers that do not degrade under the physiological conditions of the
   gastrointestinal tract and remain non-absorbed, such as carboxymethyleellulose, chitosan, and
   sulfoethylcellulose.
   [0047] The potassium binding polymer can be encased in a dialysis bag, paper bag,
   microporous matrix, polymer gel, hollow fibers, vesicles, capsules, tablet, or a film.
30 [0048] The polymers can be formed by polymerization processes using either homogeneous
   or heterogeneous mode: in the former case a crosslinked gel is obtained by reacting the
   soluble polymer chains with a crosslinker, forming a bulk gel which is either extruded and
   micronized , or comminuted to smaller sized particles. In the former case, the particles are

         WO 2005/097081                                                        PCT/US2005/010978
   obtained by emulsification or dispersion of a soluble polymer precursor, and subsequently
   crosslinked. In another method, the particles are prepared by polymerization of a monomer
   in an emulsion, suspension, miniemulsion or dispersion process. The continuous phase is
   either an aqueous vehicle or an organic solvent. When a suspension process is used, any
 5 suitable type of variants is possible, including methods such as "templated polymerization,"
   "multistage'seeded suspension," all of which yielding mostly monodisperse particles. In one
   particular embodiment, the beads are formed using a "jetting" process (see U.S. patent
   4,427,794), whereby a "tube of liquid containing a monomer plus initiator mixture is forced
   through a vibrating nozzle into a continuous phase. The nozzles can be arranged in spinning
10 turret so as to force the liquid under centrifugal force.
   [0049] A preferred process to produce alpha-fluoroacrylate beads is direct suspension
   polymerization.     Typically, suspension stabilizers, such as polyvinyl alcohol, are used to
   prevent coalescence of particles during the process. It has been observed that the addition of
   NaCl in the aqueous phase decreased coalescence and particle aggregation. Other suitable
15 salts for this purpose include salts that solubilize in the aqueous phase. In this embodiment,
   water soluble salts are added at a weight % comprised between about 0.1 to about 10,
   preferably comprised between about 2 to about 5 and even more preferably between about 3
   and about 4.
    [0050] It has been observed that in the case of alpha-fluoroacrylate esters (e.g. MeFA)
20 suspension polymerization, the nature of the free radical initiator plays a role in the quality of
   the suspension in terms of particle stability, yield of beads, and the conservation of a
    spherical shape. Use of water-insoluble free radical initiators, such as lauryl peroxide, led to
   the quasi absence of gel and produced beads in a high yield. It was found that free radical
    initiators with water solubility lower than 0.1 g/L preferably lower than 0.01 g/L led to
25  optimal results.      In preferred embodiments, polyMeFA beads are produced with a
    combination of a low water solubility free radical initiator and the presence of salt in the
    aqueous phase, such as NaCl.
    [0051] In some embodiments wherein the potassium binding polymer is used without a shell,
    the potassium binding polymer is not Kayexalate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or an
30  ammonium form of polystyrene sulfonate.
    [0052] In some embodiments, crown ethers and crown-ether like molecules are used as
   potassium binding polymers. Crown ethers show selectivity for certain alkali metals over
    others, based on the hole-size and the size of the metal ion. See Tables 2, 3 and 4 and

   passage of sodium, magnesium, calcium and other interfering molecules to the core and as a
 5 result, increase the in vivo binding capacity of a core polymer.

   [0054] The potassium binding polymers typically include cationic counterions. The cations
 5 can be metallic, non-metallic, or a combination thereof. Examples of metallic ions include,
                                                               4
   but are not limited to, Ca 2+-forn, H*-form, NH4 *-form, Na -form, or a combination thereof.
   Examples of non-metallic ions include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium,
   hydroxyalkylammonium, choline, taurine,carnitine, guanidine, creatine, adenine, and
   aminoacids or derivatives thereof.
10  [00551 In preferred embodiments, the potassium binding polymers described herein have a
   decreased tendency to cause side-effects such as hypernatremia and acidosis due to the
   release of detrimental ions. The term "detrimental ions" is used herein to refer to ions that
    are not desired to be released into the body by the compositions described herein during their
   period of use. Typically, the detrimental ions for a composition depend on the condition
15 being treated, the chemical properties, and/or binding properties of the composition. For
    example, the detrimental ion could be H which can cause acidosis or Na* which can cause
    hypernatremia. Preferably the ratio of potassium bound to detrimental cations introduced is
    1: about 2.5 to about 4.
    Core-Shell Compositions
20   [00561 In one aspect of the invention, a core-shell composition is used for the removal of
    potassium. Typically in the core-shell compositions, the core comprises a potassium-binding
    polymer, preferably the polymer being capable of binding potassium with a high binding
    capacity. The various potassium-binding polymers described herein can be used as the core
    component of the core-shell compositions. In some embodiments, the shell modulates the
25   entry of competing solutes such as magnesium and calcium across the shell to the core
     component. In one embodiment, the permeability of the membrane to divalent cations is
     diminished by decreasing the porosity to large hydrated cations such as alkaline-earth metals

          WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   ions, and by incorporating positive charges that create electrostatic repulsion with said
   multivalent cations. It is preferred that the shell of the core-shell composition is essentially
   not disintegrated during the period of residence and passage through the gastro-intestinal
   tract.
 5 [00571 The term "competing solute" as used herein means solutes that compete with
   potassium for binding to a core component, but that are not desired to be contacted and/or
   bound to the core component. Typically, the competing solute for a core-shell composition
   depends on the binding characteristics of the core and/or the permeability characteristics of
   the shell component. A competing solute can be prevented from contacting and/or binding to
10 a core-shell particle due to the preferential binding characteristics of the core component
   and/or the decreased permeability of the shell component for the competing solute from the
   external environment. Typically, the competing solute has a lower permeability from the
   external environment across the shell compared to that of potassium ions. Examples of
   competing solutes include, but are not limited to, Mg" Ca", and protonated amines.
15 10058] In some embodiments, the shell is permeable to both mono- and di-valent cations. In
   some of the embodiments in which the shell is permeable to both mono- and di-valent
   cations, the core binds preferably mono-valent cations, preferably potassium, due to the
   binding characteristics of the core. In other embodiments, the shell exhibits preferred
   permeability to potassium ions.
20 [0059] It is particularly preferred that the core-shell compositions and the potassium binding
   polymeric compositions described herein bind potassium in the parts of the gastro-intestinal
   (GI) tract which have a relatively high concentration of potassium, such as in the colon. This
   bound potassium is then preferred to remain bound to the compositions and be excreted out
   of the body.
25 [0060] In one embodiment, the shell material protects the core component from the external
   GI environment. The shell material in some embodiments protects the acid groups of the
   core polymer and prevents their exposure to the GI environment. In one embodiment, the
   core component is protected with a shell component comprising of an enteric coating.
   Suitable examples of enteric coatings are described in the art. For example, see Remington:
30 The Science and Practice of Pharmacy by A.R. Gennaro (Editor), 2 0th Edition, 2000.
   [0061] In another embodiment the shell material is engineered to impose a lower
   permeability to higher valency cations. The permeability of the shell to alkaline-earth cations
   is altered by changing the average pore size, charge density and hydrophobicity of the
   membrane. Mg* and Ca+ hydrated ions have a large size compared with monovalent

 5 [0062] Methods to reduced permeabilities to divalent cations are known from previous
   studies on cation-exchange membranes for electrodialysis (e.g. Sata et al, J.Membrane
   Science, 206 (2002), 31-60). Such methods are usually based on pore size exclusion and
   electrostatic interaction and combination thereof.
    [00631 Accordingly, in some embodiments, several characteristics of the shell component are
10 tuned so that a permeation difference is established. For example, when the mesh size of the
   shell material is in the same size range as the solute dimensions, the random walk of a bulkier
   divalent cation through the shell component is significantly slowed down. For example,
   experimental studies (Krajewska, B., Reactive and Functional polymers 47, 2001, 37-47)
   report permeation coefficients in cellulose ester or crosslinked chitosan gel membranes for
15 both ionic and non-ionic solutes shows slowing down of builder solutes when mesh size nears
   solute dimensions. The polymer volume fraction in the swollen resin is a good indicator of
   the mesh size within the composition; theoretical studies have shown, for example, that mesh
   size usually scales with 4-314, 4 being the polymer volume fraction in the shell component
   when swollen in a solution. The membrane swelling ratio depends on the hydrophobicity,
20 crosslinking density, charge density, and solvent ionic strength.
    [0064] For instance polypyrrole layered on the cation exchange materials by in-situ
   polymerization of pyrrole, is shown to induce permselectivity by creating a very tightly
   porous membrane that hinders large divalent cation diffusion relatively to monovalent
    cations.
25  [0065] Alternatively, a thin layer of a cationic polyelectrolyte is physically adsorbed to create
    a strong electrical field that repel highly charged cations such as Mg** and Cat*. Suitable
    cationic polyelectrolytes include, but are not limited to, copolymers with a repeat unit

   chitosan, adducts of aliphatic amine or aromatic amine with electrophiles such as
   epichlorhydrine, alkyihalides or epoxydes, and wherein the amine is optionally a quarternized
 5 form. Adducts of aliphatic amine or aromatic amine with alkyldihalides are also referred to
   as ionenes. The polymeric permselectivity can also be controlled by pH, whereupon the
   polymer charge density and swelling ratio varies with the rate of (de)protonation.
   [0066] pH-controlled binding selectivity is an important lever when the counter-ion initially
   loaded in the polymer has to be displaced and eventually replaced by potassium. If the
10 polymer is first conditioned with Ca", a divalent cation with a high binding constant to
   carboxylic or sulfonic groups, one can take advantage of the acidic environment encountered
   in the stomach to protonate the binding sites of the polymer so as to displace the initially
   loaded counter-ion (i.e. Ca"). In that context, it is advantageous to design polymers with ion
   exchange properties varying with the local pH, more preferably polymers with a low binding
15 capacity at gastric pH and a high capacity at pH greater than about 5.5. In one preferred
   embodiment, the polymers of the invention have a fraction of capacity available at pH lower
   than about 3, of about 0-10% of the full capacity (i.e. measure at pH about 12), and greater
   than about 50% at pH greater than about 4.

   chitosan, adducts of aliphatic amine or aromatic amine with electrophiles such as
25 epichlorhydrine, alkylhalides or epoxydes, and wherein the amine is optionally a quartemized
   form. Adducts of aliphatic amine or aromatic amine with alkyldihalides are also referred to
   as ionenes. The polymeric permselectivity can also be controlled by pH, whereupon the
   polymer charge density and swelling ratio varies with the rate of (de)protonation. The
   polymer is held on the core through physical bonds, chemical bonds, or a combination of
30 both. In the former case, the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged core and
   positively charged shell maintains the core-shell assembly during transit in the GI tract. In
   the latter case a chemical reaction is carried out at the core-shell interface to prevent
   "delamination" of the shell material.

        WO 2005/097081                                                            PCT/US2005/010978
   [0068] Preferably, the shell has a permselectivity factor (i.e. binding rate of K vs. other
   competing ions) above a certain value during the residence time of the composition in the
   large bowel. Not intending to be limited to one mechanism of action, it is believed that the
   selectivity mechanism hinges on a kinetic effect (as opposed to a pure thermodynamic
 5 mechanism for the binding event in the core). That is, if the core-shell particles of the
   invention are let to equilibrate for a period of time in the colon, it is predicted that the core
   shell will eventually bind cations with a similar profile to the core alone. Hence, in one
   embodiment the shell material keeps the rate of permeation for the target ions (e.g. K) high
   enough so that said target ions fully equilibrates during the mean average residence time in
10 the colon, while the rate of permeation of competing nations (e.g. Mg2+, Ca 2+) is lower. This
   feature is defined as the time persistence of permselectivity. In this embodiment, the time
   persistence can be the time needed to reach between about 20% and about 80% (i.e., t 20 , to
   tso) of the binding capacity at equilibrium in conditions reflecting the colon electrolyte
   profile. Typically, for K* (and monovalent cations in general), tso, is preferably lower than
15 about 5 irs, more preferably lower than about 2hrs. While for Mg (and multivalent cations in
   general), t2o, is preferably greater than about 24 hrs, most preferably about 40 hrs.
    [0069] In another embodiment, the interaction of the positively charged shell with some of
   the hydrophobic anions present the GI can achieve a higher level of persistence (as measured
   as an increase in tso value for Mg2+ and Ca2). Such hydrophobic anions include bile acids,
20 fatty acids and anionic protein digests. Alternatively anionic surfactants can provide the
    same benefit. In this embodiment the core-shell material is either administered as is, or
    formulated with fatty acids or bile acids salts or even synthetic anionic detergents such as, but
   not limited to, alkyl sulfate, alkyl sulfonate, and alkylaryl sulfonate.
    [0070] In systems which combine positive charges and hydrophobicity, preferred shell
25 polymers include amine functional polymers, such as those disclosed above, which are
    optionally alkylated with hydrophobic agents.
    [00711 Alkylation involves reaction between the nitrogen atoms of the polymer and the
    alkylating agent (usually an alkyl, alkylaryl group carrying an amine-reactive electrophile).
    In addition, the nitrogen atoms which do react with the alkylating agent(s) resist multiple
30  alkylation to form quaternary ammonium ions such that less than 10 mol % of the nitrogen
    atoms form quaternary ammonium ions at the conclusion of alkylation.
    [0072] Preferred alkylating agents are electrophiles such as compounds bearing functional
    groups such as halides, epoxides, esters, anhydrides, isocyanate, or ag-unsaturated carbonyls.

        WO 2005/097081                                                         PCT/US2005/010978
   They have the formula RX where R is a C1 -C20 alkyl (preferably C4 -C20), C1-C20
   hydroxy-alkyl (preferably C4 -C20 hydroxyalkyl), C6 -C20 aralkyl, Cl-C20 alkylammonium
   (preferably C4 -C20 alkyl ammonium), or C1 -C20 alkylamido (preferably C4 -C20 alkyl
   amido) group and X includes one or more electrophilic groups. By "electrophilic group" it is
 5 meant a group which is displaced or reacted by a nitrogen atom in the polymer during the
   alkylation reaction. Examples of preferred electrophilic groups, X, include halide, epoxy,
   tosylate, and mesylate group, In the case of, e.g., epoxy groups, the alkylation reaction
   causes opening of the three-membered epoxy ring.
   [0073] Examples of preferred alkylating agents include a C3 -C20 alkyl halide (e.g., an n
10 butyl halide, n-hexyl halide, n-octyl halide, n-decyl halide, n-dodecyl halide, n-tetradecyl
   halide, n-octadecyl halide, and combinations thereof); a C1 -C20 hydroxyalkyl halide (e.g.,
   an I1-halo-l-undecanol); a Cl -C20 aralkyl halide (e.g., a benzyl halide); a C1 -C20 alkyl
   halide ammonium salt (e.g., a (4-halobutyl) trimethylammonium salt, (6-halohexyl)trimethyl
   ammonium salt, (8-halooetyl)trimethylammonium salt, (10-halodecyl)trimethylammonium
15 salt, (12-halododecyl)-trimethylannnonium salts and combinations thereof); a Cl -C20 alkyl
   epoxy ammoniumn salt (e.g., a (glycidylpropyl)-trimethylammonium salt); and a C1 -C20
   epoxy alkylamide (e.g., an N-(2,3-eoxypropane)butyramnide, N-(2,3-epoxypropane)
   hexanamide, and combinations thereof). Benzyle halide and dodecyl halide are more
   preferred.
20  [0074J The alkylation step on the polyamine shell precursor can be carried out in a separate
   reaction, prior to the application of the shell onto the core beads. Alternatively the alkylation
   can be done once the polyamine shell precursor is deposited onto the core beads. In the latter
   case, the alkylation is preferably performed with an alkylating agent that includes at least two
   electrophilic groups X so that the alkylation also induces crosslinking within the shell layer.
25 Preferred polyfunctional alkylation agents include di-halo alkane, dihalo polyethylene glycol,
   and epichlorohydrine. Other crosslinkers containing acyl chlorides, isocyanate ,thiocyanate,
   chlorosulfonyl, activated esters (N-hydroxysuccinimide) , carbodiimide intermediates, are
    also suitable.
    100751 Typically, the level of alkylation is adjusted depending upon the nature of the
30 polyamine precursor and the size of the alkyl groups used on alkylation. Some factors that
   play a role in the level of alkylation include:
                a. Insolubility of the shell polymer under conditions of the GI tract. In
                    particular, the low pH's prevailing in the stomach tend to solubilize alkylated
                    polyamine polymers whose pH of ionization is 5 and above. For that purpose

       WO 2005/097081                                                            PCT/US2005/010978
                    higher rate of alkylation and higher chain length alkyl are preferred. As an
                     alternative, one may use an enteric coating to protect the shell material against
                     acidic pH's, said enteric coating is released when the core-shell beads are
                    progressing in the lower intestine.
 5              b. The permselectivity profile: When the alkylation ratio is low the persistence of
                    the permselectivity for competing ions (e.g. Mg2+, Ca2) can be shorter than
                    the typical residence time in the colon. Conversely when the alkylation ratio
                     (or the weight fraction of hydrophobes) is high then the material becomes
                     almost impermeable to most inorganic cations, and thus, the rate of
10                   equilibration for K* becomes long.
   Preferably, the degree of alkylation is selected by an iterative approach monitoring the two
   variables mentioned above.
   [0076] Methods for determining permeability coefficients are known. For example, see, W.
   Jost, Diffusion in Solids, Liquids and Gases, Acad. Press, New-York, 1960). For example,
15 the ion permeability coefficient in a shell polymer can be measured by casting the polymer as
   a membrane over a solid porous material, subsequently contacted with a physiological
   solution (donor) containing the ions of interest, and measuring steady state permeation rates
   of said ions, across the membrane in the acceptor solution. Membrane characteristics can
   then be optimized to achieve the best cooperation in terms of selectivity and permeation rate
20 kinetics. Structural characteristics of the membrane can be varied by modifying, for example,
   the polymer volume fraction (in the swollen membrane), the chemical nature of the
   polymer(s) and its properties (hydrophobicity, crosslinking density, charge density), the
   polymer blend composition (if more than one polymer is used), the formulation with
   additives such as wetting agents, plasticizers, and/or the manufacturing process.
25 [0077] The permselective membranes of the invention are optimized by studying their
   permselectivity profile as a function of polymer compositions and physical characteristics.
   Permselectivity is preferably measured in conditions close to those prevailing in the milieu of
   use (e.g. colon). In a typical experiment, the donor solution is a synthetic fluid with an ionic
   composition, osmolality, and pH mimicking the colonic fluid, or alternatively, an animal fluid
30 collected through ileostomy or coleostomy. In another embodiment, the membrane is
   sequentially contacted with fluids that model the conditions found in the different parts of the
   GI tract, i.e. stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In yet another embodiment, the shell
   is deposited on a cation exchange resin bead under the proton form by microencapsulation
   method and contacted with a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. By monitoring pH or

        WO 2005/097081                                                         PCT/US2005/010978
   conductivity the rate of permeation of NaOH across the membrane is then computed. In
   another embodiment the resin is preloaded with lithium cations and the release of lithium and
   absorption of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium are monitored by ion
   chromatography. In a preferred embodiment, the permeability ratio of potassium and
 5 divalent cations such as Mg" and Ca, measured in aforementioned conditions is comprised
   between about 1:0.5 to about 1:0.0001, preferably between about 1: 0.2 and about 1:0.01.
   [0078] In another embodiment, the shell of a core-shell composition displays a permeability
   selectivity by passive absorption while passing through the upper GI tract. Many components
   present in the GI tract including components of the diet, metabolites, secretion, etc. are
10 susceptible to adsorb onto and within the shell in a quasi-irreversible manner and can strongly
   modify the permeability pattern of the shell. The vast majority of these soluble materials are
   negatively charged and show various levels of hydrophobicity. Some of those species have a
   typical amphiphilic character, such as fatty acids, phospholipids, bile salts and can behave as
   surfactants. Surfactants can adsorb non-specifically to surfaces through hydrophobic
15 interactions, ionic interaction and combinations thereof. In this embodiment, this
   phenomenon is used to change the permeability of the polymeric composition upon the
   course of binding potassium ions. In one embodiment fatty acids can be used to modify the
   permeability of the shell and in another embodiment bile acids can be used. Fatty acids and
   bile acids both form aggregates micelless or vesicles) and can also form insoluble complexes
20 when mixed with positively charged polymers (see e.g. Kaneko et al, MacromolecularRapid
   Communications (2003), 24(13), 789-792). Both fatty acids and bile acids exhibit similarities
   with synthetic anionic surfactants and numerous studies report the formation of insoluble
   complexes between anionic surfactants and cationically charged polymers (e.g. Chen, L. et al,
   Macromolecules (1998), 31(3), 787-794). In this embodiment, the shell material is selected
25 from copolymers containing both hydrophobic and cationic groups, so that the shell forms a
   complex with anionically charged hydrophobes typically found in the GI tract, such as bile
    acids, fatty acids, bilirubin and related compounds. Suitable compositions also include
   polymeric materials described as bile acids sequestering agents, such as those reported in US
   Patents 5,607,669; 6,294,163; and 5,374,422; Figuly et al, Macromolecules, 1997, 30, 6174
30  6184. The formation of the complex induces a shell membrane collapse which in turn can
    lower the diffusion of bulky divalent cations, while preferably leaving the permeation of
   potassium unchanged.
    [0079] In yet another embodiment, the permeability of the shell of a core-shell composition is
   modulated by enzymatic activity in the gastro-intestinal tract. There are a number of secreted

        WO 2005/097081                                                         PCT/US2005/010978
   enzymes produced by common colonic microflora. For example Bacteroides,Prevotella,
   Porphyromonas,and Fusobacteriumproduce a variety of secreted enzymes including
   collagenase, neuraminidase, deoxyribonuclease [DNase], heparinase, and proteinases. In this
   embodiment the shell comprises a hydrophobic backbone with pendant hydrophilic entities
 5 that are cleaved off via an enzymatic reaction in the gut. As the enzymatic reaction proceeds,
   the polymer membrane becomes more and more hydrophobic, and turns from a high swollen
   state, high permeability rate material to a fully collapsed low hydration membrane with
   minimal permeability to bulky hydrated cations such as Mg" and Ca*         Hydrophilic entities
   can be chosen from natural substrates of enzymes commonly secreted in the GI tract. Such
10 entities include amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, esters, phosphate esters, oxyphosphate
   monoesters, 0- and S-phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, thiophosphate, azo groups and
   the like. Examples of enteric enzymes susceptible to chemically alter the shell polymer
   include, but are not limited to, lipases, phospholipases, carboxylesterase, glycosidases,
    azoreductases, phosphatases, amidases and proteases. The shell can be permeable to
15 potassium ions until it enters the proximal colon and then the enzymes present in the
   proximal colon can react chemically with the shell to reduce its permeability to the divalent
    cations.
    [0080] In some embodiments, the shell thickness can be between about 0.002 micron to
    about 50 micron, preferably about 0.005 micron to about 20 microns. Preferably the shell
20  thickness is more than about 0.5 micron, more preferred is more than about 2 micron, even
    more preferred is more than about 5 micron. Preferably the shell thickness is less than about
    30 micron, more preferred is less than about 20 micron, even more preferred is less than
    about 10 micron, and most preferred is less than about 5 micron.
    [0081] The size of the core-shell particles typically range from about 200 rn to about 2 mm,
25  preferably being about 100 microns. Preferably the size of the core-shell particles are more
    than about 1 microns, more preferred is more than about 10 microns, even more preferred is
    more than about 20 microns, and most preferred is more than about 40 microns. Preferably
    the size of the core-shell particles are less than about 250 microns, more preferred is less than
    about 150 microns, even more preferred is less than about 100 microns, and most preferred is
30  less than about 50 microns.
    Synthesis of core-shell particles
     [00821 In preferred embodiments, the shell is uniformly coated on the core material,
    preferably without pinholes or macroporosity and is light weight relative to the core material
    (for example, up to about 20 wt-%). The shell can be anchored to the core and preferably

         WO 2005/097081                                                           PCT/US2005/010978
   resistant enough to sustain the mechanical constraint such as swelling and compression
   encountered during tablet formulation.
    [0083) The shell can be formed by chemical or non-chemical processes. Non-chemical
   processes include spray coating, fluid bed coating, solvent coacervation in organic solvent or
 5  supercritical CO 2 , solvent evaporation, spray drying, spinning disc coating, extrusion (annular
   jet) or layer by layer formation. Examples of chemical processes include interfacial
   polymerization, grafting from, grafting unto, and core-shell polymerization.
    [0084] In fluid bed coating, typically the core beads are kept in a recirculating fluidized bed
    (Wurster type) and sprayed with a coating solution or suspension. The coating polymer can
10  be used as a solution in alcohols, ethylacetate, ketones, or other suitable solvents or as latex.
    Conditions are typically optimized so as to form a tight and homogeneous membrane layer,
    and insure that no cracks are formed upon swelling when the particles are contacted with the
    aqueous vehicle. It is preferred that the membrane polymer can yield to the volume
    expansion and elongates so as to accommodate the dimension change. Polymer membranes
15  have an elongation at break greater than 10%, preferably greater than 30%. Examples of this
    approach are reported in Ichekawa H. et al, International Journal of Pharmaceuticals,
    216(2001), 67-76.
     [0085] Solvent coacervation is described in the art. For example, see Leach, K. et al., I.
     Microencapsulation, 1999, 16(2), 153-167. In this process, typically two polymers, core
20  polymer and shell polymer are dissolved in a solvent which is further emulsified as droplets
     in an aqueous phase. The droplet interior is typically a homogeneous binary polymer
     solution. The solvent is then slowly driven off by careful distillation. The polymer solution
     in each droplet undergoes a phase separation as the volume fraction of polymer increases.
     One of the polymer migrates to the water/droplet interface and forms a more-or less perfect
25   core-shell particle (or double-walled microsphere).
     [00861 Solvent coacervation is one of the preferred methods to deposit a controlled film of
     shell polymer onto the core. In one embodiment, the coacervation technique consists in
     dispersing the core beads in a continuous liquid phase containing the shell material in a
     soluble form. The coacervation process then consists of gradually changing the solvency of
30   the continuous phase so that the shell material becomes increasingly insoluble. At the onset
     of precipitation some of the shell material ends up as a fine precipitate or film at the bead
     surface. The change in solvency can be triggered by a variety of physical chemistry means
     such as , but not limited to, changes in pH, ionic strength (i.e. osmolality), solvent
     composition (through addition of solvent or distillation), temperature (e.g when a shell

        WO 2005/097081                                                            PCT/US2005/010978
   polymer with a LCST ( lower critical solution temperature) is used), pressure ( particularly
   when supercritical fluids are used). More preferred are solvent coacervation processes when
   the trigger is either pH or solvent composition. Typically when a pH trigger event is used
   and when the polymer is selected from an amine type material, the shell polymer is first
 5 solubilized at low pH. In a second step the pH is gradually increased to reach the insolubility
   limit and induce shell deposition; the pH change is often produced by adding a base under
   strong agitation. Another alternative is to generate a base by thermal hydrolysis of a
   precursor (e.g. thermal treatment of urea to generate ammonia). The most preferred
   coacervation process is when a ternary system is used comprising the shell material and a
10 solvent/non-solvent mixture of the shell material. The core beads are dispersed in that
   homogeneous solution and the solvent is gradually driven off by distillation. The extent of
   shell coating can be controlled by on-line or off-line monitoring of the shell polymer
   concentration in the continuous phase. In the most common case where some shell material
   precipitates out of the core surface either in a colloidal form or as discrete particle, the core
15 shell particles are conveniently isolated by simple filtration and sieving. The shell thickness
   is typically controlled by the initial core to shell weight ratio as well as the extent of shell
   polymer coacervation described earlier. The core-shell beads can then be annealed to
    improve the integrity of the outer membrane as measured by competitive binding.
    [0087] Supercritical C02 coating is described in the art. For example, see Benoit J.P. et al, I.
20 Microencapsulation, 2003, 20(1)87-128. This approach is somewhat a variant of the solvent
    coacervation. First the shell coating material is dissolved in the supercritical C02, and then
    the active is dispersed in that fluid in super-critical conditions. The reactor is cooled down to
    liquid C02 conditions wherein the shell material is no longer soluble and precipitates on the
    core beads. The process is exemplified with shell materials selected from small molecules
25  such as waxes and parafins. The core-shell material is recovered as a powder.
    [0088] The spinning disc coating technique is based on forming a suspension of the core
    particles in the coating, then using a rotating disc to remove the excess coating liquid in the
    form of small droplets, while a residual coating remains around the core-particles. See U.S.
    Patent No. 4,675,140.
30  [0089] In the layer by layer process, a charged core material is contacted with a
    polyelectrolyte of opposite charge and a polymer complex is formed. This step is repeated
    until a multilayer is deposited on the core surface. Further crosslinking of the layers are
    optional.

         WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   [00901 Interfacial polymerization consists of dispersing the core material containing one
   reacting monomer in a continuous phase containing a co-reacting monomer. A
   polymerization reaction takes place at the core interface creating a shell polymer. The core
   can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Typical monomer used for that purpose can include
 5 diacylchlorides/diamines, diisocyanates/diamines, diisocyanates/diols, diacylchlorides/diols
    and bischloroformate and diamines or diols. Trifunctional monomers can also be used to
    control the degree of porosity and toughness of the membranes.
    [0091] In yet another embodiment, the shell is formed by contacting the ion exchange
   material with a polymer dispersion of opposite charge (i.e. the core material is typically
10  charged negatively and the shell positively), and filter the bead particles and anneal them in a
    fluidized bed at a temperature higher than the transition temperature (or softening point) of
    the shell polymer. In this embodiment the polymer dispersion is a latex or a polymer
    colloidal dispersion of particle size in the micron to sub-micron range.
    [00921 In one further embodiment, the shell material comprises treating the acid containing
15  core material or its derivatives such as methyl ester or acyl chloride with reactive monomer
    or polymer. Preferably the acid reactive material is a polymer and more preferably a
    polyamine: for instance a carboxylated core polymer is treated with polyethyleneimine at
    high temperature in an organic solvent to create amide bonds between the COOH groups and
    the NH and NH 2 groups. It can also be useful to activate the acid functions to facilitate the
20   amide bond formation, e.g. by treating COOH or SO 3H groups with thionylchloride or
     chlorosulfonic acid to convert said groups into their acid chloride forms. See Sata et al., Die
     Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 171, (1989) 101-117 (Nr2794).
     [0093] The process of "grafting from" involves an active site capable of initiating
     polymerization on the core surface and polymer chains are grown from the surface in
25   monolayers. Living polymerization methods such as nitroxide-mediated living
     polymerizations, ATRP, RAFT, ROMP are most suitable, but non living polymerizations
     have also been applied.
     100941 In the process of "grafting onto" a small molecule (typically an electrophile, such as
     epoxy, isocyanate, anhydride, etc.) is brought in contact with the polymeric core material,
30   said core carrying reactive species (typically nucleophile groups such as amine, alcohol, etc.).
     The thickness of the shell thus formed is controlled by the rate of diffusion of the shell small
     molecule precursor and the rate of reaction with the core. Slow-diffusing/highly reactive
     species tend to confine the reaction within a short distance from the core surface thus

        WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   producing a thin shell. Whereas, fast-diffusing/slow reacting species tend to invade the entire
   core with no defined shell and form a gradient rather than a sharp shell to core boundary.
   [0095] Core-shell polymerizations can be emulsion polymerization, suspension/mini
   emulsion polymerization, or dispersion polymerization. All these processes employ free
 5 radical polymerizations. In emulsion polymerization, the polymerization takes place in
   aqueous medium with a surfactant, monomer with a low water solubility, and a water soluble
   free radical initiator. Polymer particles are formed by micellar or homogeneous nucleation or
   both. Core shell particles can be formed theoretically by feeding the core monomer first and
   the shell monomer second as long as the monomer is spontaneously consumed as it is fed
10 ("starved regime"). The potassium binding core beads are preferably made from a water
   insoluble monomer (e.g. alkylester of a-fluoro-acrylic acid).
    [00961 In suspension/mini-emulsion polymerization, the free radical initiator is soluble with
   the monomer. Monomer and initiator are pre-dissolved and then emulsified in droplet
   stabilized with either surfactant or amphiphilic polymers. This method allows one pre
15 formed polymer (e.g. the shell polymer) to be dissolved as well. When the reaction proceeds,
   the shell polymer and the core polymer phase separate to form the desired core-shell
   particles.
    [00971 In dispersion polymerization, both the monomer and the initiator are soluble in the
    continuous phase (usually an organic solvent). A block copolymer is used as a steric
20  stabilizer. The polymer particles are formed by homogenous nucleation and subsequent
    growth. Particle size are on the 1 to 10 microns range and mono-dispersed.
    10098] In a preferred process of dispersion, polymerization employs a refinement reported in
    Stover H. et al, Macromolecules, 1999, 32, 2838-2844, described thereafter: The shell
    monomer contains a large fraction of divinyl monomer, such as 1,4 divinylbenzene, while the
25  core particles present some polymerizable double bond on their surface; the shell
    polymerization mechanism is based on the formation of short oligoradicals in the continuous
    phase, which are captured by the double bond present on the particle surface. The oligomers
    themselves contain non-reacted insaturation that replenish the surface in reactive double
    bonds. The net result is a formation of a crosslinked shell with a sharp boundary with the
30  shell and the core material.
     100991 In one embodiment, a core-shell composition of the invention is synthesized by
    forming the cation exchange core in a conventional inverse suspension process using suitable
    monomers; decorating the particle surface with reactive double bonds by post-reacting with
    the acidic group present on the particle core; and dispersing in typical dispersion

   Methods of Treatments
    [00101]        The methods and compositions described herein are suitable for treatment of
   hyperkalemia caused by disease and/or use of certain drugs.
15  [00102]        In some embodiments of the invention, the compositions and methods
    described herein are used in the treatment of hyperkalemia caused by decreased excretion of
   potassium, especially when intake is not reduced. A common cause of decreased renal
    potassium excretion is renal failure (especially with decreased glomerular filtration rate),
    often coupled with the ingestion of drugs that interfere with potassium excretion, e.g.,
20  potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), non-steroidal
    anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin, or trimethoprim. Impaired responsiveness of the distal
    tubule to aldosterone, for example in type IV renal tubular acidosis observed with diabetes
    mellitus as well as sickle cell disease and/or chronic partial urinary tract obstruction is
    another cause of reduced potassium secretion. Secretion is also inhibited in diffuse
25  adrenocortical insufficiency or Addison's disease and selective hypoaldosteronism.
    Hyperkalemia is common when diabetics develop hypoteninemic hypoaldosteronism or renal
    insufficiency (Mandal, A.K. 1997. Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. Med Clin North Am.
    81:611-39).
     [00103]        In certain preferred embodiments, the potassium binding polymers described
30  herein are administered chronically. Typically, such chronic treatments will enable patients
    to continue using drugs that cause hyperkalemia, such as potassium-sparing diuretics,
    ACEI's, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin, or trimethoprim. Also, use of the
    polymeric compositions described herein will enable certain patient populations, who were
    unable to use hyperkalemia causing drugs, to use such drugs.

         WO 2005/097081                                                         PCT/US2005/010978
   [00104]          In certain chronic use situations, the preferred potassium binding polymers
   used are those that are capable of removing less than about 5 mmol of potassium per day or in
   the range of about 5 - about 10 mmol of potassium per day. In acute conditions, it is
   preferred that the potassium binding polymers used are capable of removing about 15 - about
 5 60 mmol of potassium per day.
   [001051          In certain other embodiments, the compositions and methods described herein
   are used in the treatment of hyperkalemia caused by a shift from intracellular to extracellular
   space. Infection or trauma resulting in cell disruption, especially rhabdomyolysis or lysis of
   muscle cells (a major potassium store), and tumor lysis can result in acute hyperkalemia.
10 More often, mild-to-moderate impairment of intracellular shifting of potassium occurs with
   diabetic ketoacidosis, acute acidosis, infusion of argentine or lysine chloride for the treatment
   of metabolic alkalosis, or infusion of hypertonic solutions such as 50% dextrose or mannitol.
   p-receptor blocking drugs can cause hyperkalemia by inhibiting the effect of epinephrine.
    [00106]         In certain other embodiments, the compositions and methods described herein
15 are used in the treatment of hyperkalemia caused by excessive intake of potassium.
   Excessive potassium intake alone is an uncommon cause of hyperkalemia. Most often,
   hyperkalemia is caused by indiscriminate potassium consumption in a patient with impaired
   mechanisms for the intracellular shift of potassium or renal potassium excretion. For
    example, sudden death among dialyzed patients who are noncompliant in diet can be
20  attributed to hyperkalemia.
    [00107]          In the present invention, the potassium-binding polymers and the core-shell
    compositions can be co-administered with other active pharmaceutical agents. This co
    administration can include simultaneous administration of the two agents in the same dosage
    form, simultaneous administration in separate dosage forms, and separate administration. For
25  example, for the treatment of hyperkalemia, the potassium-binding polymers and the core
    shell compositions can be co-administered with drugs that cause the hyperkalemia, such as
    potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-convening enzyme inhibitors, non-steroidal anti
    inflammatory drugs, heparin, or trimethoprim. The drug being co-administered can be
    formulated together in the same dosage form and administered simultaneously.
30  Alternatively, they can be simultaneously administered, wherein both the agents are present
    in separate formulations. In another alternative, the drugs are administered separately. In the
    separate administration protocol, the drugs may be administered a few minutes apart, or a few
    hours apart, or a few days apart.

        WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   [001081         The term "treating" as used herein includes achieving a therapeutic benefit
   and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication, amelioration, or
   prevention of the underlying disorder being treated. For example, in a hyperkalemia patient,
   therapeutic benefit includes eradication or amelioration of the underlying hyperkalemia.
 5 Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication, amelioration, or prevention of
   one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that
   an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be
   afflicted with the underlying disorder. For example, administration of a potassium-binding
   polymer to a patient suffering from hyperkalemia provides therapeutic benefit not only when
10 the patient's serum potassium level is decreased, but also when an improvement is observed
   in the patient with respect to other disorders that accompany hyperpkalemia like renal failure.
   For prophylactic benefit, the potassium-binding polymers may be administered to a patient at
   risk of developing hyperpkalemia or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological
   symptoms of hyperpkalemia, even though a diagnosis of hyperpkalemia may not have been
15 made.
   1001091          The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include
   compositions wherein the potassium binding polymers are present in an effective amount,
   i.e., in an amount effective to achieve therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The actual amount
   effective for a particular application will depend on the patient (e.g., age, weight, etc.), the
20 condition being treated, and the route of administration. Determination of an effective
   amount is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the
   disclosure herein.
    1001101         The effective amount for use in humans can be determined from animal
   models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve gastrointestinal
25 concentrations that have been found to be effective in animals.
    [00111]         The dosages of the potassium binding polymers in animals will depend on the
   disease being, treated, the route of administration, and the physical characteristics of the
   patient being treated. Dosage levels of the potassium binding polymers for therapeutic and/or
   prophylactic uses can be from about about 0.5 gm/day to about 30 gm/day. It is preferred
30 that these polymers are administered along with meals. The compositions may be
   administered one time a day, two times a day, or three times a day. Most preferred dose is
   about 15 gm/day or less. A preferred dose range is about 5 gm/day to about 20 gm/day, more
   preferred is about 5 gm/day to about 15 gm/day, even more preferred is about 10 gm/day to
   about 20 gm/day, and most preferred is about 10 gm/day to about 15 gm/day.

       WO 2005/097081                                                          PCT/US2005/010978
   1001121          In some embodiments, the amount of potassium bound by the core-shell
   compositions is greater than the amount if the core component, i.e., potassium binding
   polymer is used in the absence of the shell. Hence, the dosage of the core component in some
   embodiments is lower when used in combination with a shell compared to when the core is
 5 used without the shell. Hence, in some embodiments of the core-shell pharmaceutical
   compositions, the amount of core component present in the core-shell pharmaceutical
   composition is less than the amount that is administered to an animal in the absence of the
   shell component.
   [001131          The compositions described herein can be used as food products and/or food
10 additives. They can be added to foods prior to consumption or while packaging to decrease
   levels of potassium. The compositions can also be used in fodder for animals to lower K
   levels, which is for example desirable for example in fodders for pigs and poultry to lower
   the water secretion.
   Formulations and Routes of Administration
15 [00114]          The polymeric compositions and core-shell compositions described herein or
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be delivered to the patient using a wide variety
   of routes or modes of administration. The most preferred routes for administration are oral,
   intestinal, or rectal.
   [00115]          If necessary, the polymers and core-shell compositions may be administered in
20 combination with other therapeutic agents. The choice of therapeutic agents that can be
   co-administered with the compounds of the invention will depend, in part, on the condition
   being treated.
    [001161         The polymers (or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) may be
   administered per se or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition wherein the active
25 compound(s) is in admixture or mixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
   carriers, excipients or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the
   present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more
   physiologically acceptable carriers compromising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate
   processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.
30 Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.
    [001171         For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by
   combining the active compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in
   the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills,
   dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, wafers, and the like, for oral

        WO 2005/097081                                                            PCT/US2005/010978
   ingestion by a patient to be treated. In one embodiment, the oral formulation does not have
   an enteric coating. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as a solid
   excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules,
   after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable
 5 excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or
   sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch,
   potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, mehtyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose,
   sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). If desired,
   disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or
10 alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
    100118]          Dragee cores can be provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose,
   concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc,
   polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer
    solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be
15  added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different
    combinations of active compound doses.
    [00119]          For administration orally, the compounds may be formulated as a sustained
    release preparation. Numerous techniques for formulating sustained release preparations are
    known in the art.
20  [00120]          Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit
    capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer,
    such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in
    admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc
    or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds
25  may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid
    polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral
    administration should be in dosages suitable for administration.
    [001211          In some embodiments the polymers of the invention are provided as
    pharmaceutical compositions in the form of chewable tablets. In addition to the active
30  ingredient, the following types of excipients are commonly used: a sweetening agent to
    provide the necessary palatability, plus a binder where the former is inadequate in providing
    sufficient tablet hardness; a lubricant to minimize fictional effects at the die wall and
    facilitate tablet ejection; and, in some formulations a small amount of a disintegrant is added
    to facilitate mastication. In general excipient levels in currently-available chewable tablets

       WO 2005/097081                                                           PCT/US2005/010978
   are on the order of 3-5 fold of active ingredient(s) whereas sweetening agents make up the
   bulk of the inactive ingredients.
   [001221          The present invention provides chewable tablets that contain a polymer or
   polymers of the invention and one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for formulation
 5 of a chewable tablet. The polymer used in chewable tablets of the invention preferably has a
   swelling ratio while transiting the oral cavity and in the esophagus of less than about 5,
   preferably less than about 4, more preferably less than about 3, more preferably less than 2.5,
   and most preferably less than about 2. The tablet comprising the polymer, combined with
   suitable excipients, provides acceptable organoleptic properties such as mouthfeel, taste, and
10 tooth packing, and at the same time does not pose a risk to obstruct the esophagus after
   chewing and contact with saliva.
   [00123]          In some aspects of the invention, the polymer(s) provide mechanical and
   thermal properties that are usually performed by excipients, thus decreasing the amount of
   such excipients required for the formulation. In some embodiments the active ingredient
15 (e.g., polymer) constitutes over about 30%, more preferably over about 40%, even more
   preferably over about 50%, and most preferably more than about 60% by weight of the
   chewable tablet, the remainder comprising suitable excipient(s). In some embodiments the
   polymer comprises about 0.6 gm to about 2.0 gm of the total weight of the tablet, preferably
   about 0.8 gm to about 1.6 gin. In some embodiments the polymer comprises more than about
20 0.8 gi of the tablet, preferably more than about 1.2 gm of the tablet, and most preferably
   more than about 1.6 gm of the tablet. The polymer is produced to have appropriate
   strength/friability and particle size to provide the same qualities for which excipients are
   often used, e.g., proper hardness, good mouth feel, compressibility, and the like. Unswelled
   particle size for polymers used in chewable tablets of the invention is less than about 80, 70,
25 60, 50, 40, 30, or 20 microns mean diameter. In preferred embodiments, the unswelled
   particle size is less than about 80, more preferably less than about 60, and most preferably
   less than about 40 microns.
   [001241          Pharmaceutical excipients useful in the chewable tablets of the invention
   include a binder, such as microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silica and combinations thereof
30 (Prosolv 90), carbopol, providone and xanthan gum; a flavoring agent, such as sucrose,
   mannitol, xylitol, maltodextrin, fructose, or sorbitol; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate,
   stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumurate and vegetable based fatty acids; and, optionally, a
   disintegrant, such as croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, low-substituted hydroxypropyl
   ether of cellulose, sodium starch glycolate. Other additives may include plasticizers,

   lubricant, wherein the filler is chosen from the group consisting of sucrose, mannitol, xylitol,
10 maltodextrin, fructose, and sorbitol, and wherein the lubricant is a magnesium fatty acid salt,
    such as magnesium stearate.
    [00126]          The tablet may be of any size and shape compatible with chewability and
   mouth disintegration, preferably of a cylindrical shape, with a diameter of about 10 mm to
    about 40 mm and a height of about 2 mm to about 10 mm, most preferably a diameter of
15  about 22 mm and a height of about 6 mm.
    [00127]          In one embodiment, the polymer is pre-formulated with a high Tg / high
    melting point low molecular weight excipient such as mannitol, sorbose, sucrose in order to
    form a solid solution wherein the polymer and the excipient are intimately mixed. Method of
    mixing such as extrusion, spray-drying, chill drying, lyophilization, or wet granulation are
20  useful. Indication of the level of mixing is given by known physical methods such as
    differential scanning calorimetry or dynamic mechanical analysis.
    [00128]          Methods of making chewable tablets containing pharmaceutical ingredients,
    including polymers, are known in the art. See, e.g., European Patent Application No.

     cooled to room temperature.
10   [00133]          The gel was transferred to a 50-mi polypropylene tube and water was added to
     a total volume of 30 ml. The gel was crushed with a spatula, and further milled with an

10  vacuum distillation according to a method described by Breslow et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
    1954, 76, 6399-6401). The pure acid was then dissolved in water and neutralized with NaOH
    solution carefully at 0"C. The colorless salt solution was concentrated by vacuum distillation
    to a concentration of 56 wt. %.
    [00135]         To a 15-mi test tube were charged NaVSA solution, crosslinker, and a

   General procedure for preparation ofpoly(vinylsulfamate) gel:
   [001381           Polyvinylamine hydrochloride (PVAm.HCI) was prepared according to a
   literature procedure by Badesso et al (in HydrophilicPolymers: Performancewith
   Environmentalacceptance, P489-504). PVAm gel was prepared by the crosslinking reaction
 5 of PVAm.HC1 with epichlorohydrin. The procedure was as follows: to a 100ml of round
   bottom flask was charged 33 wt% PVAm.HCl aqueous solution (15 gin, 62.9 mmol),
   followed by 50 wt% NaOH solution (2.63gm) to neutralize 50 mol% of PVAm.HCl.
   Epichlorohydrin (1.0 gm) was added and the mixture was stirred magnetically until stirring
   stopped due to gel formation. The gel was further cured at 65 0C for 12 hours and transferred
10 to a 50-ml polypropylene tube, and then water was added to a total volume of 30 ml. The gel
   was crushed with a spatula, and further milled with an Ultra-Turrax. The gel was washed
   with 1M HCI and nanopure water using the procedure described for FAA gel. Finally,
   PVAm gel was freeze dried for 3 days.
   General procedure for preparingpoly(vinylsulfamn ate) gel:
15 [00139]           To a 20 ml vial was added 0.5 gm of PVAm gel and 10 ml of solvent. The
   mixture was heated at 60 0 C for hour, then 0.5 gin of sulfur trioxide trimethylanine
   (S0 3 .N(CH3 ) 3 ) was added. Inorganic base, Na 2 CO 3 or 2M NaOH solution, was added to the
   reaction mixture to maintain the pH above 9. The mixture was heated at 600C for a certain
   time. The mixture was centrifuged, and supernatant solution was decanted off. The gel was
20 washed with nanopure water until pH reached 7, and freeze dried. The reaction conditions
   and the conversion of amine group to sulfamate group are shown in Table 12.

   Example 2: Binding Capacity Screening Protocol
 5 [00140]         All experiments were performed in duplicate. Approximately 30mg of each
   polymer was aliquoted in duplicate into l6xlOOmm glass test tubes. Dowex 50W and
   Amberlite CG-50 were included in each experiment as internal controls. The relevant test
   binding buffer (Buffer 1, Buffer 2 or Buffer 3 below) was added to a final resin concentration
   of 2.5mg/ml. The test tubes were sealed using a Teflon membrane and incubated at room
10 temperature, with constant end-over-end rotation, for at least one hour to allow the cations to
   achieve binding equilibrium with the polymers. The test tubes were then centrifuged at 500g
   for thirty minutes to isolate the resins. A sample of the supernatant was taken and the
   equilibrium concentrations of potassium (Kq) and sodium (Na*t) were determined by Ion
   Chromatography (IC). By comparing Kt, and Na,           with the concentration of potassium in
15 Buffer 1, Buffer 2 or Buffer 3 in the absence of polymer (Ktt and Nattan), the amount of
   cation (in mmoles cation/gram of polymer) was calculated. The ratio of sodium and
   potassium bound to the polymer was also calculated in this manner.

   New York).
10       1. Approximately 50mg of polymer (acid-fonn) was measured into l5xlOmm glass test
             tubes.
        2. The volume of IM NaOH required to generate the required mEq was calculated, and
             enough water was added to the tubes to keep the ratio of solution volume to resin
             weight constant.
15       3. The required mEq of NaOH was added to the polymer from a 1M NaOH stock.
         4. The tubes were sealed and rotated for 4 days to allow to come to equilibrium
         5. The equilibrated pH was measured while continuing to mix.
    [001441            The results are shown in Figure 16. This example shows that polyalpha
    fluoroacrylate has a lower pKa (equal to pH value at half-neutralization) than a methacrylic
20  containing ion-exchange resin such as Amberlite CG50. The pKa value for the FAA gel
   material (100982A1 from Table 11) can be estimated from Figure 16 at about 5.6 versus 8 for

   Example 3: Procedure for predicting binding of nations in the human GI
   [001451          This procedure was used to model the conditions of use of a potassium binder
 5 drug and measure the binding characteristics of the polymer for potassium (target solute) in
   the presence of other competing cations. A meal mimic was prepared and artificially
   digested in the presence of pepsin and pancreatic juice. The sequence of addition of enzymes
   and the pH profile were controlled so that the digestion process was simulated down to the
   jejunum level. The test polymers, preloaded with lithium, were added to the digested meal
10 mimic and allowed to equilibrate for a fixed period of time; the mixture was then centrifuged
   and the supernatant was assayed for Na, K+, NH 4 , Ca2+, and Mge by ion chromatography.
   The lithium released was computed as the total cation exchange, while the decrease in
   concentrations of the other cations was used to compute their binding variations in western
    diets.

   Preparation of Resin
    [00146]          Resin (test resin, or Dowex 50WX4-200 used as a comparative), was washed
    extensively in 1M HCt to convert it to the H-form. It was then washed extensively in 1M
    LiOH. Excess LiOH was removed by washing in ddH2 0. The resins were lyophilized and
20  stored in a desiccator.

    depicts binding of cations by resins in meal mimic.
    Measurement of binding capacities in cecal andfecal extracts
    [001481          Two volumes (w/v) of ice-cold ddH 20 were added to the human feces and to
25  normal rabbit cecal contents. These were incubated with rotation at 4"C with end-over-end
    rotation for at least hour to extract soluble cations. Fecal and cecal extracts, as well as
    thawed meal mimics, were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes to clarify. Approximately
    50mg Li-form Dowex SOW was weighed into l6xlOOmm glass test tubes. Control test tubes
    were included that contained no resin. Clarified extracts or mimics were added to a final
30  resin concentration of 2.5mg/ml. 5-10ml of extracts or mimic were added to the control test
    tubes. Tubes were sealed and rotated at 4"C for 90 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged at
    5OOg for thirty minutes to precipitate the resin. Supernatant samples were taken. The
    samples were then prepared for ion chromatography by spinning at 13,000g for ten minutes,
    taking the supernatant and rapidly passing across a 3000Da cutoff dialysis membrane by

   columns. Start (without resin) and equilibrium (with resin) concentrations of Li, Nat K,
   NHt Ca" and Mg" were determined, and the amount (in mmoles cation/gm resin) of Li+
   released, as well as Na, K*, NH 4 , Ca** and Mg" bound were calculated.
 5 Procedure for measuring the binding of cations by resins in humanfecal extracts
    [00149]        Resins and feces were prepared as follows. Resins were washed extensively
   in IM HCI to convert them to the H-form. Excess HCl was removed by washing in ddH 20.
   The resins were lyophilized and stored in a desiccator. Fecal samples were obtained from
   two human subjects, frozen immediately and stored at -80*C to minimize ammonium
10 production ex vivo.
    [00150]        All experiments were performed in triplicate. Error bars on Figures 3 and 4
   indicate standard deviations values. Fecal samples were resuspended in two volumes of ice
    cold ddH 20 (w/v) and incubated overnight at 4"C to extract soluble cations. The extract was
   then clarified by centrifuging at 2000g for ten minutes. H-form resins were weighed into
15  disposable 15ml-capacity columns. They were them washed extensively in 150mM LiOH to
    convert them to the Li-form. They were washed in ddH 20 to remove excess LiOH. Clarified
    fecal extract was applied to the columns to a final resin concentration of 2.5mg/mi of extract.
    A sample was retained for calculating resin concentrations in the absence of resin. Columns
    were capped and rotated at 4*C for three hours. They were then eluted by centrifugation into
20  50ml polypropylene tubes. The pH of eluted extracts and retained clarified fecal extracts
    were measured (it had not changed: Sample 1 pH was 6.75, sample 2 pH was 7.1). The
    samples were then prepared for ion chromatography by spinning at 13,000g for ten minutes,
    taking the supernatant and rapidly passing across a 3000Da cutoff dialysis membrane by
    centrifugation. Extracts were farther diluted 1:5 (v/v) in ddH20 before applying to the IC
25  columns. Start (without resin) and equilibrium (with resin) concentrations of Li, Na, K,
    NHI, Ca* and Mg** were determined, and the amount (in mmoles cation/gm resin) of Li+
    released, as well as Na, K, NHf, Ca44 and Mg** bound were calculated. In Figure 4 'Total
    occupied" refers to the sum of Li* (i.e. monovalent) binding sites occupied by the other
    cations, taking into account the divalent nature of Ca** and Mg**.
30   [001511        Data presented in Figure 4 demonstrate that the ex-vivo binding of potassium
    in human fecal extracts for the FAA based material is about twice as much that of Dowex
     50WX4-200 (a material essentially identical in composition to the potassium binder
    Kayexalate). The ex-vivo binding of potassium by the Dowex resin is essentially the same as
    that reported for polystyrene sulfonate resins in human clinical studies, which establishes this

   method as a good predictor for in-vivo binding performance. It also indicates that other
   cations, in particular Magnesium and Calcium, compete with potassium for the binding sites
   of the polymers. Figure 3 depicts the original concentrations of cations in the Feces of
   Subject 1 and Subject 2. Figure 4 depicts the binding of cations in human fecal extracts to
 5 cation exchange resins.
   Example 4: Method of selection of semi-permeable membrane with high potassium
   binding selectivity over magnesium and calcium
   [001521         This protocol describes a method to optimize polymeric materials with regards
   to their ion permselectivity characteristics, which then can be used as the shell component for
10 the making of potassium selective core-shell ion-exchange particles.
   Polymer synthesis and membrane preparation:
   [00153]         Polymeric membrane materials with different compositions were prepared by
   radical copolymerization of DBA (N, N'-dibutyl acrylamide) and DEAEMA (NN'
15 diethylaminoethylnethacrylate) in a glove box using miniaturized reactors in a library
   format. AIBN was used as the initiator and ethanol as the solvent. Polymers were isolated
   by precipitation into water, freeze-dried, and characterized by GPC and H-NMR. The
   composition of the polymer (DBA mol%) ranges from 30% to 70% and molecular weight
   ranges from 200K to 300K as shown below:

   [00154]          Polymer membranes were prepared by casting a 2-wt% toluene solution of
   DBA-co-DEAEMA onto a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane (RC membrane with
   MWCO of 14 K). After toluene was evaporated, a polymer membrane was formed on the top
25 of dialysis membrane. A composite membrane of polymer membrane and RC membrane was
   thus prepared.

   Permeability study on cations
   [001551         The composite membrane was first clamped onto a glass tube with diameter of
   13 mm, and then immersed into a 2 L of donor solution of cations. The tube was filled with
   10 ml of acceptor solution (lactose solution with the same osmolality as the donor solution
 5 (240mM)). The acceptor solution was sampled at a specified time interval and analyzed by
   ion chromatography. See Figure 5.
   [00156]         Donor solution was prepared by mixing the aqueous solution of NaCl, KC1,
   CaCl 2.2H 20, and MgSO 4 .7H 2 0. The solution was buffered to pH 6 by using 14 mM of IES
   (2-[N-morpholine]ethanesulfonic acid] solution. The concentrations of different cations
                                                                                 2

   [Ca2+], 22.324 mM.
    [00157]         Determination of the permeability coefficient (P) of different cations: As
   mentioned in the measurement set-up, the acceptor solution was sampled at a specific time
   interval and analyzed by IC. Assuming a Fick's first law of diffusion, P is readily obtained
15 by linearization of the data, following a method of calculation reported in equation 1 in G.
   Van den Mooter, C. Samyn, and R. Kinget, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 111, 127
    136(1994). The permeability coefficients of different cations were thus calculated from the
    slope from this linear relationship.

    permselectivity for cations Ml and M2 can be calculated as follows: PMIM = P(M2)/P(M1)
    Permeability coefficients of different cations through different membranes:
    [00159]         Table 14 shows the permeability coefficients of different cations at different
    membranes. When polymers are more hydrophilic (Polymer D3 and D4 with DBA% 48.5
                                                                  2
30  and 56.1%, respectively), all cations, such as Na+, K, Mg +, and Ca+, are more permeable
    and their permeability coefficients are comparable to those through a blank dialysis
    membrane (RC membrane) and reflect the self-diffusivity of the cations. However, with the

        WO 2005/097081                                                               PCT/US2005/010978
   increasing DBA content in polymer membrane (See Table 15 for D5 and D6), the
   permeability coefficients of different cations decreased as compared with blank membrane,
   which means that the hydrophobic nature of polymer membrane could make cations less
   permeable through the hydrophobic barrier.

10  [00160]         Another characteristic for the permeability of different cations is their
   permselectivity. By normalizing the value of PNa+ as 1, the permselectivity for other cations
   can be calculated and the results are shown in Table 16. The permselectivity of PMg/PNa and
   Pca/PNa decreases with the increasing DBA content in polymer membranes, which implies
   that more hydrophobic polymer membranes may have better selectivity for different cations.
15 For a better selectivity for different cations, two factors should be considered - the charge
   density and the membrane hydrophobicity.

   steam stripping. The beads are then filtered and treated with aqueous 3M NaOH to hydrolyze
   the polymer, then washed, treated with HCL, water-washed, and finally dried to form the

   measured by Master Sizer (Malvern UK).

    [00162]         The core-shell particles are prepared by forming a coating of polymer D2 on
   the poly-2-fluoroacrylic acid beads prepared in example 5 using a Wurster coater. The shell
   polymer prepared in example 4 is first dissolved at 20 wt-% in toluene, and the thus obtained
10  solution then dispersed in water in a 1: 4 weight ratio with 2 wt-% based on the organic phase
    of CTAB (Hexadecyltrimethyl-Ammonium Bromide) as a surfactant, using a Ultra-Turrax
   high-shear homogeneizer. The toluene is then driven off by evaporation under reduced
   pressure. The average diameter of the dispersion particles is 0.3 micrometer, as measured by
    Dynamic Light Scattering. The poly-2-fluoroacrylic acid beads are spray-coated with the
15  shell polymer dispersion using a Wurster fluid bed coater 2"- 4"/6" Portable Unit. The
    fluidized bed unit is operated so that an average 5 microns thick coating is deposited on the
    core particles.

    in Example 3 is expected to be twice higher than that measured with the uncoated poly-a

   Method for binding study
   [00167]         A mixture of NaCl, KCl, MgC 2 , and CaC 2 was dissolved in a MES buffer
10 (pH6.0) (MES, 2-[N-morpholine]ethanesulfonic acid]. The concentration for each cation was
   determined by IC. The concentrations for Na, K, Mg2 +, and Ca 2+ are 26.4 mM, 9.75 mM,
   4.75 mM and 4.16 mM respectively.
    [00168]        Weighed dried PEI-coated bead was put into a tube which contains 5-ml of
   MES buffer solution of NaCI, KCl, MgC 2, and CaC 2 . The tube was sealed and tumbled.
15 After a certain period of time as indicated in figure 6, the tube was centrifuged. 100
   microliter of solution was then taken out from the supernatant for IC analysis. The binding
   amount of PEI coated beads for different cations were calculated from the concentration
   change in the solution.

   [00169]         The binding data of different PEI coated beads for different cations are shown
   in Figure 6. PEI coated Dowex beads show higher Na and K binding than the uncoated
   beads (bare beads). The coated beads show much more selective binding than bare beads.
   The thicker the PEI coating (e.g. Dowex (2.5wt-6h), coated from 2.5 wt% PEI solution for 6
 5 hours), the more selective for the different cations. The binding kinetic study shows that the
   binding of cations equilibrates faster for the thinner coated beads and bare beads.

   Examle 10: FAA beads with benzylated polyethylene imine shell
   [001791        The shell was applied on the FAA core by the process of solvent coacervation.
   The shell, Ben(84)-PEI, was dissolved in methanol and water mixture (3:1) at pH of 4.5. The
   shell and core were mixed for 5 minutes and methanol was removed by rotovap (40 minutes),
 5 isolated, washed, and dried.
   [00180]         Binding was measured under following conditions:
                   Donor solutions: 50 mM KC1 and 50 mM MgC12

10 [001811         The potassium binding was calculated from actual magnesium uptake and
   overall binding capacity of polymer which was 5.74 meq/gm. The results are shown in
   Figure 10. Increasing the ratio of shell/core caused a decrease in magnesium binding which
   indicates an increase in potassium binding.
   Example 11: Coating by controlled precipitation induced bypH change
15  [00182]        The shell comprised of Benzylated PEI, Ben (-20%); and Ben (-40%) on a
   Dowex(K) core. Binding was measured in 50 mM KC1 and 50 mM MgC12 .
    [00183]        Figure 11 shows the results of the binding experiments. Controlled
   precipitation method for 40% benzylated PEI shows better coating and this combination of
    coating method and materials gives higher binding selectivity.
20 Example 12: Membrane screening of Shell Polymers
    [00184]        Shell polymers were screened by coating a flat membrane via solvent casting
    and using the coated membrane as the barrier in a diffusion cell, as depicted in Figure 15.
    Donor solution was 50mM 2-[N-morpholino] ethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer at pH6.5
    with 50mM K+ and Mg". Permeability coefficient was calculated as described in Example 4
25  above. Cross-linked B-PEI was tested using this method. B-PEI (35mol%) was cross-linked
    with 1, 4-butanediol diacrylate. The cross-linker was reacted on the top of dried B-PEI for 4
    hours. The screening was performed in 50 mM KCI and 50 mM MgCl2 in 50 mM MES
    buffer. Cross-linker (diacrylate) reacted with B-PEI (35 mol%) membrane. As shown in
    Figure 13, addition of the cross-linker reduced permeability coefficient and also showed good
30  selectivity.
    [00185]        Blends of Eudragit RL 100 and RS 100 were also evaluated using the method
    of Figure 12. The results are shown in Figure 14. Adding RSOO into RL1OO can reduce the
    permeability and the permselectivity stays in the same range. Membranes with more than

 5 supernatant was removed and the coat was further crosslinked with 1,2-Bis-(2-iodoethoxy)
   ethane (BIEE). Binding was measured in 50 mM KCl and 50 mM of MgCl2, MES buffer,
   pH 6.5. Bile acids extract used was 2 mg/nml (bile extract porcine with 60% bile acids and
   40% unknowns, i.e., free fatty acids, phospholipids, etc.). Time: 6 and 24 hrs and Bead
   content: 4 mg/ml. Results are shown in Figures 15A and 15B. Enhanced performance of the
