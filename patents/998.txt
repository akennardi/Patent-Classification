ABSTRACT
Methods and systems for processing polynucleotides (e.g. DNA) are disclosed. A processing
region includes one or more surfaces (e.g., particle surfaces) modified with ligands that
regain polynucleotides under a first set of conditions (e.g., temperature and pH) and release
the polynucleotides under a second set of conditions (e.g., higher temperature and/or more
basic pH). The processing region can be used to, for example, concentrate polynucleotides of
a sample and/or separate inhibitors of amplification reactions from the polynucleotides.
Microfluidic devices with a processing region are disclosed.

   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to methods for processing polynucleotide-containing
   samples as well as to related systems.

   BACKGROUND
            The    analysis   of a biological    sample   often  includes   detecting  one   or more
   polynucleotides present in the sample. One example of detection is qualitative detection, which
   relates, e.g., to the determination of the presence of the polynucleotide and/or the determination
 0 of information related to, e.g., the type, size, presence or absence of mutations, and/or the
   sequence of the polynucleotide. Another example of detection is quantitative detection, which
   relates, e.g., to the determination of the amount of polynucleotide present.        Detection may
   include both qualitative and quantitative aspects.
            Detecting polynucleotides often involves the use of an enzyme.         For example, some
?5 detection methods include polynucleotide amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
   a related amplification technique.         Other detection methods that do not amplify the
   polynucleotide to be detected also make use of enzymes. However, the functioning of enzymes
   used in such techniques may be inhibited by the presence of inhibitors present along with the
   polynucleotide to be detected. The inhibitors may interfere with, for example, the efficiency
30 and/or specificity of the enzymes.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            One aspect of the present invention relates to a method and related systems for
   processing one or more polynucleotide(s) (e.g., to concentrate the polynucleotide(s) and/or to
35 separate the polynucleotides from inhibitor compounds (e.g., haemoglobin) that might inhibit
   detection and/or amplification of the polynucleotides).

             In some embodiments, the method includes contacting the polynucleotides and a
    relatively immobilized compound that preferentially associates with (e.g., retains) the
    polynucleotides as opposed to inhibitors. An exemplary compound is a poly-cationic polyamide
    (e.g., poly-L-lysine and/or the poly-D-lysine), which may be bound to a surface (e.g., a surface
 5  of one or more particles). The compound retains the polynucleotides so that the polynucleotides
    and inhibitors may be separated, such as by washing the surface with the compound and
    associated polynucleotides. Upon separation, the association between the polynucleotide and
    compound may be disrupted to release (e.g., separate) the polynucleotides from the compound
    and surface.
 )           In some embodiments, the surface (e.g., a surface of one or more particles) is modified
    with a poly-cationic polyamide, which may be covalently bound to the surface. The poly
    cationic polyamide may include at least one of poly-L-lysine and poly-D-lysine. In some
    embodiments, the poly-cationic polyamide (e.g., the at least one of the poly-L-lysine and the
    poly-D-lysine) have an average molecular weight of at least about 7500 Da. The poly-cationic
 5  polyamide (e.g., the at least one of the poly-L-lysine and the poly-D-lysine) may have an average
    molecular weight of less than about 35,000 Da (e.g., an average molecular weight of less than
    about 30000 Da (e.g., an average molecular weight of about 25,000 Da)). The poly-cationic
   polyamide (e.g., the at least one of the poly-L-lysine and the poly-D-lysine) may have a median
   molecular weight of at least about 15,000 Da. The poly-cationic polyamide (e.g., the at least one
   of the poly-L-lysine and the poly-D-lysine) may have a median molecular weight of less than
   about 25,000 Da (e.g., a median molecular weight of less than about 20,000 Da (e.g., a median
   molecular weight of about 20,000 Da).
            Another aspect of the invention relates to a sample preparation device including a surface
   including a poly-cationic polyamide bound thereto and a sample introduction passage in
5  communication with the surface for contacting the surface with a fluidic sample.
            In some embodiments, the device includes a heat source configured to heat an aqueous
   liquid in contact with the surface to at least about 65 *C.
            In some embodiments, the device includes a reservoir of liquid having a pH of at least
   about 10 (e.g., about 10.5 or more). The device is configured to contact the surface with the
0  liquid (e.g., by actuating a pressure source to move the liquid).
            In some embodiments, the surface comprises surfaces of a plurality of particles.

             In some embodiments, the poly-cationic polyamide includes poly-L-lysine and/or poly
    D-lysine.
             Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for processing a sample including
    providing a mixture including a liquid and an amount of polynucleotide, contacting a retention
 5  member with the mixture. The retention member may be configured to preferentially retain
    polynucleotides as compared to polymerase chain reaction inhibitors. Substantially all of the
    liquid in the mixture is removed from the retention member. The polynucleotides are released
    from the retention member.
             The polynucleotide may have a size of less than about 7.5 Mbp.
 0           The liquid may be a first liquid and removing substantially all of the liquid from the
    retention member may include contacting the retention member with a second liquid.
             Contacting the retention member with a second liquid can include actuating a thermally
    actuated pressure source to apply a pressure to the second liquid. Contacting the retention
   member with a second liquid can include opening a thermally actuated valve to place the second
 5  liquid in fluid communication with the retention member.
             The second liquid may have a volume of less than about 50 microliters.
             The retention member may include a surface having a compound configured to bind
   polynucleotides preferentially to polymerase chain reaction inhibitors (e.g., hemoglobin,
   peptides, faecal compounds, humic acids, mucousol compounds, DNA binding proteins, or a
 3 saccharide).
            The surface may include a poly-lysine (e.g., poly-L-lysine and/or poly-D-lysine).
            The second liquid may include a detergent (e.g., SDS).
            Releasing may include heating the retention member to a temperature of at least about 50
   "C (e.g., at about 65 *C). The temperature may be insufficient to boil the liquid in the presence
5  of the retention member during heating. The temperature may be 100 *C or less (e.g., less than
   100 *C, about 97 *C or less). The temperature may be maintained for less than about 10 minutes
   (e.g., for less than about 5 minutes, for less than about 3 minutes).
            The releasing may be performed without centrifugation of the retention member.
            In certain embodiments, PCR inhibitors are rapidly removed from clinical samples to
0  create a PCR-ready sample. The method may comprise the preparation of a polynucleotide
   containing sample that is substantially free of inhibitors. The samples may be prepared from,
   e.g., crude lysates resulting from thermal, chemical, ultrasonic, mechanical, electrostatic, and
                                                      3

         WO 2005/108620                                                          PCT/US2005/015345
     other lysing techniques. The samples may be prepared without centrifugation. The samples may
     be prepared using microfluidic devices or on a larger scale.
             Another aspect of the invention relates to a retention member, e.g., a plurality of particles
     such as beads, comprising bound poly-lysine, e.g., poly-L-lysine, and related methods and
 5   systems. The retention member preferentially binds polynucleotides, e.g., DNA, as compared to
    inhibitors. The retention member may be used to prepare polynucleotides samples for further
    processing, such as amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
             In certain embodiments, more than 90% of a polynucleotide present in a sample may be
    bound to the retention member, released, and recovered.
 )           In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide may be bound to the retention member,
    released, and recovered, in less than 10 minutes, less than 7.5 minutes, less than 5 minutes, or
    less than 3 minutes.
            A polynucleotide may be bound to a retention member, released, and recovered without
    subjecting the polynucleotide, retention member, and/or inhibitors to centrifugation.
            Separating the polynucleotides and inhibitors generally excludes subjecting the
   polynucleotides, inhibitors, processing region, and/or retention member to sedimentation (e.g.,
   centrifugation).
            Another aspect of the invention relates to a microfluidic device including a channel, a
   first mass of a thermally responsive substance (TRS) disposed on a first side of the channel, a
   second mass of a TRS disposed on a second side of the channel opposite the first side of the
   channel, a gas pressure source associated with the first mass of the TRS. Actuation of the gas
   pressure source drives the first mass of the TRS into the second mass of the TRS and obstructs
   the channel.
            The microfluidic device can include a second gas pressure source associated with the
5  second mass of the TRS. Actuation of the second gas pressure source drives the second mass of
   TRS into the first mass of TRS.
            At least one (e.g., both) of the first and second masses of TRS may be a wax.
            Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for obstructing a channel of a
   microfluidic device. A mass of a TRS is heated and driven across the channel (e.g., by gas
D  pressure) into a second mass of TRS. The second mass of TRS may also be driven (e.g., by gas
   pressure) toward the first mass of TRS.
            Another aspect of the invention relates to an actuator for a microfluidic device. The
                                                        4

        WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
    actuator includes a channel, a chamber connected to the channel, at least one reservoir of
    encapsulated liquid disposed in the chamber, and a gas surrounding the reservoir within the
    chamber. Heating the chamber expands the reservoir of encapsulated liquid and pressurizes the
    gas. Typically the liquid has a boiling point of about 90 "C or less. The liquid may be a
 5  hydrocarbon having about 10 carbon atoms or fewer.
             The liquid may be encapsulated by a polymer.
             The actuator may include multiple reservoirs of encapsulated liquid disposed in the
    chamber.
             The multiple reservoirs may be dispersed within a solid (e.g., a wax).
 0           The multiple reservoirs may be disposed within a flexible enclosure (e.g., a flexible
    sack).
             Another aspect of the invention relates to a method including pressurizing a gas within a
    chamber of a microfluidic to create a gas pressure sufficient to move a liquid within a channel of
   the microfluidic device. Pressurizing the gas typically expanding at least one reservoir of
 5  encapsulated liquid disposed within the chamber.
             Expanding the at least one reservoir can include heating the chamber.
             Pressurizing the gas can include expanding multiple reservoirs of encapsulated liquid.
             Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for combining (e.g., mixing) first and
   second liquids and related devices. The device includes a mass of a temperature responsive
 ) substance (TRS) that separates first and second channels of the device. The device is configured
   to move a first liquid along the first channel so that a portion (e.g., a medial portion) of the first
   liquid is adjacent the TRS and to move a second liquid along the second channel so that a portion
   (e.g., a medial portion) of second liquid is adjacent the TRS. A heat source is actuated to move
   the TRS (e.g., by melting, dispersing, fragmenting). The medial portions of the first and second
5  liquids typically combine without being separated by a gas interface. Typically, only a subset of
   the first liquid and a subset of the second liquid are combined. The liquids mix upon being
   moved along a mixing channel.
            Another aspect of the invention relates to a lyophilized reagent particle and a method of
   making the particle.
0           In some embodiments, the lyophilized particles include multiple smaller particles each
   having a plurality of ligands that preferentially associate with polynucleotides as compared to
   PCR inhibitors. The lyophilized particles can also (or alternatively) include lysing reagents (e.g.,
                                                      5

        WO 2005/108620                                                            PCT/US2005/015345
    enzymes) configured to lyse cells to release polynucleotides. The lyophilized particles can also
    (or alternatively) include enzymes (e.g., proteases) that degrade proteins.
             Cells can be lysed by combining a solution of the cells with the lyophilized particles to
    reconstitute the particles. The reconstituted lysing reagents lyse the cells. The polynucleotides
 5  associate with ligands of the smaller particles. During lysis, the solution may be heated (e.g.,
    radiatively using a lamp (e.g., a heat lamp).
            In some embodiments, lyophilized particles include reagents (e.g., primers, control
    plasmids, polymerase enzymes) for performing a PCR reaction.
            A method for making lyophilized particles includes forming a solution of reagents of the
 0  particle and a cryoprotectant (e.g., a sugar or poly-alcohol). The solution is deposited dropwise
    on a chilled hydrophobic surface (e.g., a diamond film or polytetrafluoroethylene surface). The
   particles freeze and are subjected to reduced pressure (typically while still frozen) for a time
    sufficient to remove (e.g., sublimate) the solvent. The lyophilized particles may have a diameter
    of about 5 mm or less (e.g., about 2.5 mm or less, about 1.75 mm or less).

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            Analysis of biological samples often includes determining whether one or more
    polynucleotides (e.g., a DNA, RNA, mRNA, or rRNA) is present in the sample. For example,
    one may analyze a sample to determine whether a polynucleotide indicative of the presence of a
 5  particular pathogen is present. Typically, biological samples are complex mixtures. For
    example, a sample may be provided as a blood sample, a tissue sample (e.g., a swab of, for
    example, nasal, buccal, anal, or vaginal tissue), a biopsy aspirate, a lysate, as fungi, or as
    bacteria. Polynucleotides to be determined may be contained within particles (e.g., cells (e.g.,
    white blood cells and/or red blood cells), tissue fragments, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria
 3  and/or gram negative bacteria), fungi, spores). One or more liquids (e.g., water, a buffer, blood,
   blood plasma, saliva, urine, spinal fluid, or organic solvent) is typically part of the sample and/or
    is added to the sample during a processing step.
            Methods for analyzing biological samples include providing a biological sample (e.g., a
    swab), releasing polynucleotides from particles (e.g., bacteria) of the sample, amplifying one or
5  more of the released polynucleotides (e.g., by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), and
   determining the presence (or absence) of the amplified polynucleotide(s) (e.g., by fluorescence
   detection). Biological samples, however, typically include inhibitors (e.g., mucousal
   compounds, hemoglobin, faecal compounds, and DNA binding proteins) that can inhibit
   determining the presence of polynucleotides in the sample. For example, such inhibitors can
0  reduce the amplification efficiency of polynucleotides by PCR and other enzymatic techniques
   for determining the presence of polynucleotides. If the concentration of inhibitors is not reduced
   relative to the polynucleotides to be determined, the analysis can produce false negative results.

            We describe methods and related systems for processing biological samples (e.g.,
    samples having one or more polynucleotides to be determined). Typically, the methods and
    systems reduce the concentration of inhibitors relative to the concentration of polynucleotides to
    be determined.
 5          Referring to Fig. 1, a microfluidic device 200 includes first, second, and third layers 205,
    207, and 209 that define a microfluidic network 201 having various components configured to
    process a sample including one or more polynucleotides to be determined. Device 200 typically
    processes the sample by increasing the concentration of a polynucleotide to be determined and/or
    by reducing the concentration of inhibitors relative to the concentration of polynucleotide to be
 D  determined.
            We now discuss the arrangement of components of network 201.
            Network 201 includes an inlet 202 by which sample material can be introduced to the
    network and an output 236 by which a processed sample can be removed (e.g., expelled by or
    extracted from) network 201. A channel 204 extends between inlet 202 and ajunction 255. A
 5  valve 205 is positioned along channel 204. A reservoir channel 240 extends between junction
   255 and an actuator 244. Gates 242 and 246 are positioned along channel 240. A channel 257
    extends between junction 255 and a junction 257. A valve 208 is positioned along channel 257.
   A reservoir channel 246 extends between junction 259 and an actuator 248. Gates 250 and 252
   are positioned along channel 246. A channel 261 extends between junction 259 and a junction
 ) 263. A valve 210 and a hydrophobic vent 212 are positioned along channel 261. A channel 256
   extends between junction 263 and an actuator 254. A gate 258 is positioned along channel 256.
           A channel 214 extends between junction 263 and a processing chamber 220, which has
   an inlet 265 and an outlet 267. A channel 228 extends between processing chamber outlet 267
   and a waste reservoir 232. A valve 234 is positioned along channel 228. A channel 230 extends
5  between processing chamber outlet 267 and output 236.
           We turn now to particular components of network 201.
           Referring also to Fig. 2, processing chamber 220 includes a plurality of particles (e.g.,
   beads, microspheres) 218 configured to retain polynucleotides of the sample under a first set of
   conditions (e.g., a first temperature and/or first pH) and to release the polynucleotides under a
0  second set of conditions (e.g., a second, higher temperature and/or a second, more basic pH).
   Typically, the polynucleotides are retained preferentially as compared to inhibitors that may be
   present in the sample. Particles 218 are configured as a retention member 216 (e.g., a column)

     through which sample material (e.g., polynucleotides) must pass when moving between the inlet
     265 and outlet 267 of processing region 220.
             A filter 219 prevents particles 218 from passing downstream of processing region 220. A
     channel 287 connects filter 219 with outlet 267. Filter 219 has a surface area within processing
 5  region 220 that is larger than the cross-sectional area of inlet 265. For example, in some
     embodiments, the ratio of the surface area of filter 219 within processin region 220 to the cross
    sectional area of inlet 265 (which cross sectional area is typically about the same as the cross
    sectional area of channel 214) is at least about 5 (e.g., at least about 10, at least about 20, at least
    about 20). In some embodiments, the surface area of filter 219 within processing region 220 is at
 0  least about 1 mm2 (e.g., at least about 2 mm2, at least about 3 mm). In some embodiments, the
    cross-sectional area of inlet 265 and/or channel 214 is about 0.25 mm 2 or less (e.g., about 0.2
    mm2 or less, about 0.15 mm2 or less, about 0.1 mm 2 or less). The larger surface area presented
    by filter 219 to material flowing through processing region 220 helps prevent clogging of the
    processing region while avoiding significant increases in the void volume (discussed below) of
 5  the processing region..
             Particles 218 are modified with at least one ligand that retains polynucleotides (e.g.,
   preferentially as compared to inhibitors). Typically, the ligands retain polynucleotides from
   liquids having a pH about 9.5 or less (e.g., about 9.0 or less, about 8.75 or less, about 8.5 or less).
   As a sample solution moves through processing region 220, polynucleotides are retained while
 ) the liquid and other solution components (e.g., inhibitors) are less retained (e.g., not retained)
   and exit the processing region. In general, the ligands to release polynucleotides when the pH is
   about 10 or greater (e.g., about 10.5 or greater, about 11.0 or greater). Consequently,
   polynucleotides can be released from the ligand modified particles into the surrounding liquid.
            Exemplary ligands include, for example, polyamides (e.g., poly-cationic polyamides such
5  as poly-L-lysine, poly-D-lysine, poly-DL-omithine). Other ligands include, for example,
   intercalators, poly-intercalators, minor groove binders polyamines (e.g., spermidine),
   homopolymers and copolymers comprising a plurality of amino acids, and combinations thereof.
   In some embodiments, the ligands have an average molecular weight of at least about 5000 Da
   (e.g., at least about 7500 Da, of at least about 15000 Da). In some embodiments, the ligands
0  have an average molecular weight of about 50000 Da or less (e.g., about 35000, or less, about
   27500 Da or less). In some embodiments, the ligand is a poly-lysine ligand attached to the
   particle surface by an amide bond.

              In certain embodiments, the ligands are resistant to enzymatic degradation, such as
     degradation by protease enzymes (e.g., mixtures of endo- and exo-proteases such as pronase) that
     cleave peptide bonds. Exemplary protease resistant ligands include, for example, poly-D-lysine
     and other ligands that are enantiomers of ligands susceptible to enzymatic attack.
 5            Particles 218 are typically formed of a material to which the ligands can be associated.
    Exemplary materials from which particles 218 can be formed include polymeric materials that
    can be modified to attach a ligand. Typical polymeric materials provide or can be modified to
    provide carboxylic groups and/or amino groups available to attach ligands. Exemplary
    polymeric materials include, for example, polystyrene, latex polymers (e.g., polycarboxylate
 )  coated latex), polyacrylamide, polyethylene oxide, and derivatives thereof Polymeric materials
    that can used to form particles 218 are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,235,313 to Mathiowitz et
    al., which patent is incorporated herein by reference Other materials include glass, silica,
    agarose, and amino-propyl-tri-ethoxy-silane (APES) modified materials.
             Exemplary particles that can be modified with suitable ligands include carboxylate
 5 particles (e.g., carboxylate modified magnetic beads (Sera-Mag Magnetic Carboxylate modified
   beads, Part #3008050250, Seradyn) and Polybead carboxylate modified microspheres available
    from Polyscience, catalog no. 09850). In some embodiments, the ligands include poly-D-lysine
    and the beads comprise a polymer (e.g., polycarboxylate coated latex).
             In general, the ratio of mass of particles to the mass of polynucleotides retained by the
   particles is no more than about 25 or more (e.g., no more than about 20, no more than about 10).
   For example, in some embodiments, about 1 gram of particles retains about 100 milligrams of
   polynucleotides.
             Typically, the total volume of processing region 220 (including particles 218) between
   inlet 265 and filter 219 is about 15 microliters or less (e.g., about 10 microliters or less, about 5
5  microliters or less, about 2.5 microliters or less, about 2 microliters or less). In an exemplary
   embodiment, the total volume of processing region 220 is about 2.3 microliters. In some
   embodiments, particles 218 occupy at least about 10 percent (e.g., at least about 15 percent) of
   the total volume of processing region 220. In some embodiments, particles 218 occupy about 75
   percent or less (e.g., about 50 percent or less, about 35 percent or less) of the total volume of
0  processing chamber 220.
            In some embodiments, the volume of processing region 220 that is free to be occupied by
   liquid (e.g., the void volume of processing region 220 including interstices between particles

    218) is about equal to the total volume minus the volume occupied by the particles. Typically,
    the void volume of processing region 220 is about 10 microliters or less (e.g., about 7.5
    microliters or less, about 5 microliters or less, about 2.5 microliters or less, about 2 microliters or
    less). In some embodiments, the void volume is about 50 nanoliters or more (e.g., about 100
 5  nanoliters or more, about 250 nanoliters or more). In an exemplary embodiment, the total
    volume of processing region 220 is about 2.3 microliters. For example, in an exemplary
    embodiment, the total volume of the processing region is about 2.3 microliters, the volume
    occupied by particles is about 0.3 microliters, and the volume free to be occupied by liquid (void
   volume) is about 2 microliters.
 D          Particles 218 typically have an average diameter of about 20 microns or less (e.g., about
    15 microns or less, about 10 microns or less). In some embodiments, particles 218 have an
   average diameter of at least about 4 microns (e.g., at least about 6 microns, at least about 8
   microns).
            In some embodiments, a volume of channel 287 between filter 219 and outlet 267 is
 5 substantially smaller than the void volume of processing region 220. For example, in some
   embodiments, the volume of channel 287 between filter 219 and outlet 267 is about 35% or less
   (e.g., about 25 % or less, about 20 % or less) of the void volume. In an exemplary embodiment,
   the volume of channel 287 between filter 219 and outlet 267 is about 500 microliters.
            The particle density is typically at least about 108 particles per milliliter (e.g., about 109
 ) particles per milliliter). For example, a processing region with a total volume of about 1
   microliter may include about 103 beads.
           Filter 219 typically has pores with a width smaller than the diameter of particles 218. In
   an exemplary embodiment, filter 219 has pores having an average width of about 8 microns and
   particles 218 have an average diameter of about 10 microns.
5          In some embodiments, at least some (e.g., all) of the particles are magnetic. In alternative
   embodiments, few (e.g., none) of the particles are magnetic.
           In some embodiments, at least some (e.g., all) the particles are solid. In some
   embodiments, at least some (e.g., all) the particles are porous (e.g., the particles may have
   channels extending at least partially within them).
0          Channels of microfluidic network 201 typically have at least one sub-millimeter cross
   sectional dimension. For example, channels of network 201 may have a width and/or a depth of
   about 1 mm or less (e.g., about 750 microns or less, about 500 microns, or less, about 250
                                                       11

         WO 2005/108620                                                            PCT/US2005/015345
     microns or less).
             A valve is a component that has a normally open state allowing material to pass along a
     channel from a position on one side of the valve (e.g., upstream of the valve) to a position on the
     other side of the valve (e.g., downstream of the valve). Upon actuation, the valve transitions to a
 5   closed state that prevents material from passing along the channel from one side of the valve to
     the other. For example, valve 205 includes a mass 251 of a thermally responsive substance
     (TRS) that is relatively immobile at a first temperature and more mobile at a second temperature.
     A chamber 253 is in gaseous communication with mass 251. Upon heating gas (e.g., air) in
     chamber 253 and heating mass 251 of TRS to the second temperature, gas pressure within
 0   chamber 253 moves mass 251 into channel 204 obstructing material from passing therealong.
     Other valves of network 201 have the same structure and operate in the same fashion as valve
     205.
             A mass of TRS can be an essentially solid mass or an agglomeration of smaller particles
    that cooperate to obstruct the passage. Examples of TRS's include a eutectic alloy (e.g., a
 5  solder), wax (e.g., an olefin), polymers, plastics, and combinations thereof. The first and second
    temperatures are insufficiently high to damage materials, such as polymer layers of device 200.
    Generally, the second temperature is less than about 90 0 C and the first temperature is less than
    the second temperature (e.g., about 70 'C or less).
            A gate is a component that has a normally closed state that does not allow material to
 )  pass along a channel from a position on one side of the gate to another side of the gate. Upon
    actuation, the gate transitions to a closed state in which material is permitted to pass from one
    side of the gate (e.g., upstream of the gate) to the other side of the gate (e.g., downstream of the
    gate). For example, gate 242 includes a mass 271 of TRS positioned to obstruct passage of
   material between junction 255 and channel 240. Upon heating mass 271 to the second
5  temperature, the mass changes state (e.g., by melting, by dispersing, by fragmenting, and/or
   dissolving) to permit passage of material between junction 255 and channel 240.
            The portion of channel 240 between gates 242 and 246 forms a fluid reservoir 279
   configured to hold a liquid (e.g., water, an organic liquid, or combination thereof). During
   storage, gates 242 and 246 limit (e.g., prevent) evaporation of liquid within the fluid reservoir.
0  During operation of device 200, the liquid of reservoir 279 is typically used as a wash liquid to
   remove inhibitors from processing region 220 while leaving polynucleotides associated with
   particles 218. Typically, the wash liquid is a solution having one or more additional components
                                                       12

         WO 2005/108620                                                            PCT/US2005/015345
     (e.g., a buffer, chelator, surfactant, a detergent, a base, an acid, or a combination thereof).
    Exemplary solutions include, for example, a solution of 10-50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 0.5-2 mM
    EDTA, and 0.5% - 2% SDS, a solution of 10-50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 0.5 to 2 mM EDTA, and
     0.5% -2% Triton X-100.
 5            The portion of channel 246 between gates 250 and 252 form a fluid reservoir 281
    configured like reservoir 279 to hold a liquid (e.g., a solution) with limited or no evaporation.
    During operation of device 200, the liquid of reservoir 281 is typically used as a release liquid
    into which polynucleotides that had been retained by particles 218 are released. An exemplary
    release liquid is an hydroxide solution (e.g., a NaOH solution) having a concentration of, for
 0  example, between about 2 mM hydroxide (e.g., about 2 mM NaOH) and about 500 mM
    hydroxide (e.g., about 500 mM NaOH). In some embodiments, liquid in reservoir 281 is an
    hydroxide solution having a concentration of about 25 mM or less (e.g., an hydroxide
    concentration of about 15 mM).
              Reservoirs 279, 281 typically hold at least about 0.375 microliters of liquid (e.g., at least
 5  about 0.750 microliters, at least about 1.25 microliters, at least about 2.5 microliters). In some
    embodiments, reservoirs 279, 281 hold about 7.5 microliters or less of liquid (e.g., about 5
   microliters or less, about 4 microliters or less, about 3 microliters or less).
             An actuator is a component that provides a gas pressure that can move material (e.g.,
    sample material and/or reagent material) between one location of network 201 and another
 )  location. For example, referring to FIG. 3, actuator 244 includes a chamber 272 having a mass
   273 of thermally expansive material (TEM) therein. When heated, the TEM expands decreasing
   the free volume within chamber 272 and pressurizing the gas (e.g., air) surrounding mass 273
   within chamber 272. Typically, gates 246 and 242 are actuated with actuator 244.
   Consequently, the pressurized gas drives liquid in fluid reservoir 279 towards junction 255. In
5  some embodiments, actuator 244 can generate a pressure differential of more than about 3 psi
   (e.g., at least about 4 psi, at least about 5 psi) between the actuator and junction 255.
             The TEM includes a plurality of sealed liquid reservoirs (e.g., spheres) 275 dispersed
   within a carrier 277. Typically, the liquid is a high vapor pressure liquid (e.g., isobutane and/or
   isopentane) sealed within a casing (e.g., a polymeric casing formed of monomers such as
0  vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile and methylmethacrylate). Carrier 277 has properties (e.g.,
   flexibility and/or an ability to-soften (e.g., melt) at higher temperatures) that permit expansion of
   the reservoirs 275 without allowing the reservoirs to pass along channel 240. In some
                                                        13

        WO 2005/108620                                                            PCT/US2005/015345
    embodiments, carrier 277 is a wax (e.g., an olefin) or a polymer with a suitable glass transition
    temperature. Typically, the reservoirs make up at least about 25 weight percent (e.g., at least
    about 35 weight percent, at least about 50 weight percent) of the TEM. In some embodiments,
    the reservoirs make up about 75 weight percent or less (e.g., about 65 weight percent or less,
 5  about 50 weight percent or less) of the TEM. Suitable sealed liquid reservoirs can be obtained
    from Expancel (Akzo Nobel).
             When the TEM is heated (e.g., to a temperature of at least about 50 'C (e.g., to at least
    about 75 'C, at least about 90 C)), the liquid vaporizes and increases the volume of each sealed
   reservoir and of mass 273. Carrier 277 softens allowing mass 273 to expand. Typically, the
 D TEM is heated to a temperature of less than about 150 'C (e.g., about 125 *C or less, about 110
    'C or less, about 100 *C or less) during actuation. In some embodiments, the volume of the
   TEM expands by at least about 5 times (e.g., at least about 10 times, at least about 20 times, at
   least about 30 times).
             A hydrophobic vent (e.g., vent 212) is a structure that permits gas to exit a channel while
 5 limiting (e.g., preventing) liquid from exiting the channel. Typically, hydrophobic vents include
   a layer of porous hydrophobic material (e.g., a porous filter such as a porous hydrophobic
   membrane from Osmonics) that defines a wall of the channel. As discussed below, hydrophobic
   vents can be used to position a microdroplet of sample at a desired location within network 201.
            Hydrophobic vents typically have a length of at least about 2.5 mm (e.g., at least about 5
 ) mm, at least about 7.5 mm) along a channel. The length of the hydrophobic vent is typically at
   least about 5 times (e.g., at least about 10 times, at least about 20 times) larger than a depth of
   the channel within the hydrophobic vent. For example, in some embodiments, the channel depth
   within the hydrophobic vent is about 300 microns or less (e.g., about 250 microns or less, about
   200 microns or less, about 150 microns or less).
5           The depth of the channel within the hydrophobic vent is typically about 75% or less (e.g.,
   about 65% or less, about 60% or less) of than the depth of the channel upstream and downstream
   of the hydrophobic vent. For example, in some embodiments the channel depth within the
   hydrophobic vent is about 150 microns and the channel depth upstream and downstream of the
   hydrophobic vent is about 250 microns.
0           A width of the channel within the hydrophobic vent is typically at least about 25% wider
   (e.g., at least about 50% wider) than a width of the channel upstream from the vent and
   downstream from the vent. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the width of the channel
                                                     14

     downstream from the vent is about 250 microns.
             Microfluidic device 200 can be fabricated as desired. Typically, layers 205, 207, and 209
     are formed of a polymeric material. Components of network 201 are typically formed by
 5   molding (e.g., by injection molding) layers 207, 209. Layer 205 is typically a flexible polymeric
     material (e.g., a laminate) that is secured (e.g., adhesively and/or thermally) to layer 207 to seal
     components of network 201. Layers 207 and 209 may be secured to one another using adhesive.
             In use, device 200 is typically thermally associated with an array of heat sources
    configured to operate the components (e.g., valves, gates, actuators, and processing region 220)
 3  of the device. In some embodiments, the heat sources are integral with an operating system,
    which operates the device during use. The operating system includes a processor (e.g., a
    computer) configured to actuate the heat sources according to a desired protocol. Processors
    configured to operate microfluidic devices are described in U.S. application no. 09/819,105, filed
    March 28, 2001, which application is incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments,
 5  the heat sources are integral with the device itself.
            Device 200 may be operated as follows. Valves of network 201 are configured in the
    open state. Gates of network 201 are configured in the closed state. A fluidic sample
    comprising polynucleotides is introduced to network 201 via inlet 202. For example, sample can
   be introduced with a syringe having a Luer fitting. The syringe provides pressure to initially
 ) move the sample within network 201. Sample passes along channels 204, 257, 261, and 214 to
   inlet 265 of processing region 220. The sample passes through processing region 220, exits via
   outlet 267, and passes along channel 228 to waste chamber 232. When the trailing edge (e.g.,
   the upstream liquid-gas interface) of the sample reaches hydrophobic vent 212, pressure
   provided by the introduction device (e.g., the syringe) is released from network 201 stopping
5  further motion of the sample.
            Typically, the amount of sample introduced is about 500 microliters or less (e.g., about
   250 microliters or less, about 100 microliters or less, about 50 microliters or less, about 25
   microliters or less, about 10 microliters or less). In some embodiments, the amount of sample is
   about 2 microliters or less (e.g., of about 0.5 microliters or less).
0           Polynucleotides entering processing region 220 pass through interstices between the
   particles 218. Polynucleotides of the sample contact retention member 216 and are preferentially
   retained as compared to liquid of the sample and certain other sample components (e.g.,
                                                        15

         WO 2005/108620                                                          PCT/US2005/015345
     inhibitors). Typically, retention member 220 retains at least about 50% of polynucleotides (at
     least about 75%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%) of the polynucleotides present in the
     sample that entered processing region 220. Liquid of the sample and inhibitors present in the
     sample exit the processing region 220 via outlet 267 and enter waste chamber 232. Processing
 5  region is typically at a temperature of about 50 *C or less (e.g., 30 *C or less) during introduction
     of the sample.
             Processing continues by washing retention member 216 with liquid of reservoir 279 to
    separate remaining inhibitors from polynucleotides retained by retention member 216. To wash
    retention member 216, valve 206 is closed and gates 242, 246 of first reservoir 240 are opened.
 0  Actuator 244 is actuated and moves wash liquid within reservoir 279 along channels 257, 261,
    and 214, through processing region 220, and into waste reservoir 232. The wash liquid moves
    sample that may have remained within channels 204, 257, 261, and 214 through the processing
    region and into waste chamber 232. Once the trailing edge of the wash liquid reaches vent 212,
    the gas pressure generated by actuator 244 is vented and further motion of the liquid is stopped.
 5           The volume of wash liquid moved by actuator 244 through processing region 220 is
   typically at least about 2 times the void volume of processing region 220 (e.g., at least about 3
   times the void volume) and can be about 10 times the void volume or less (e.g., about 5 times the
   void volume or less). Processing region is typically at a temperature of about 50 "C or less (e.g.,
   30 "C or less) during washing. Exemplary wash fluids include liquids discussed with respect to
 ) reservoirs 279 and 281.
             Processing continues by releasing polynucleotides from retention member 216.
   Typically, wash liquid from reservoir 279 is replaced with release liquid (e.g., an hydroxide
   solution) from reservoir 281 before releasing the polynucleotides. Valve 208 is closed and gates
   250, 252 are opened. Actuator 248 is actuated thereby moving release liquid within reservoir
5  281 along channels 261, 214 and into processing region 220 and in contact with retention
   member 216. When the trailing edge of release liquid from reservoir 281 reaches hydrophobic
   vent 212, pressure generated by actuator 248 is vented stopping the further motion of the liquid.
   The volume of liquid moved by actuator 248 through processing region 220 is typically at least
   about equal to the void volume of the processing region 220 (e.g., at least about 2 times the void
0  volume) and can be about 10 times the void volume or less (e.g., about 5 times the void volume
   or less).
            Once retention member 216 with retained polynucleotides has been contacted with liquid
                                                     16

        WO 2005/108620                                                             PCT/US2005/015345
     from reservoir 281, a releasing step is typically performed. Typically, the releasing step includes
     heating release liquid present within processing region 216. Generally, the liquid is heated to a
     temperature insufficient to boil liquid in the presence of the retention member. In some
     embodiments, the temperature is 100 "C or less (e.g., less than 100 "C, about 97 "C or less). In
 5   some embodiments, the temperature is about 65 "C or more (e.g., about 75 "C or more, about 80
     "C or more, about 90 "C or more). In some embodiments, the temperature maintained for about 1
    minute or more (e.g., about 2 minutes or more, about 5 minutes or more, about 10 minutes or
    more). In some embodiments, the temperature is maintained for about 30 minutes (e.g., about 15
    minutes or less, about 10 minutes or less, about 5 minutes or less). In an exemplary
 0  embodiment, processing region 220 is heated to between about 65 and 90 'C (e.g., to about 70
      C) for between about 1 and 7 minutes (e.g., for about 2 minutes).
             The polynucleotides are released into the liquid present in the processing region 220
    (e.g., the polynucleotides are typically released into an amount of release liquid having a volume
    about the same as the void volume of the processing region 220). Typically, the polynucleotides
 5  are released into about 10 microliters or less (e.g., about 5 microliters or less, about 2.5
    microliters or less) of liquid.
             In certain embodiments, the ratio of the volume of original sample moved through the
   processing region 220 to the volume of liquid into which the polynucleotides are released is at
    least about 10 (e.g., at least about 50, at least about 100, at least about 250, at least about 500, at
 )  least about 1000). In some embodiments, polynucleotides from a sample having a volume of
    about 2 ml can be retained within the processing region, and released into about 4 microliters or
   less (e.g., about 3 microliters or less, about 2 microliters or less, about 1 microliter or less) of
   liquid.
             The liquid into which the polynucleotides are released typically includes at least about
5  50% (e.g., at least about 75%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%) of the polynucleotides
   present in the sample that entered processing region 220. The concentration of polynucleotides
   present in the release liquid may be higher than in the original sample because the volume of
   release liquid is typically less than the volume of the original liquid sample moved through the
   processing region. For example the concentration of polynucleotides in the release liquid may be
0  at least about 10 times greater (e.g., at least about 25 times greater, at least about 100 times
   greater) than the concentration of polynucleotides in the sample introduced to device 200. The
   concentration of inhibitors present in the liquid into which the polynucleotides are released is
                                                        17

          WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
      generally less than concentration of inhibitors in the original fluidic sample by an amount
      sufficient to increase the amplification efficiency for the polynucleotides.
              The time interval between introducing the polynucleotide containing sample to
      processing region 220 and releasing the polynucleotides into the release liquid is typically about
  5   15 minutes or less (e.g., about 10 minutes or less, about 5 minutes or less).
              Liquid including the released polynucleotides may be removed from the processing
      region 220 as follows. Valves 210 and 234 are closed. Gates 238 and 258 are opened. Actuator
      254 is actuated to generate pressure that moves liquid and polynucleotides from processing
     region 220, into channel 230, and toward outlet 236. The liquid with polynucleotides can be
  )  removed using, for example, a syringe or automated sampling device. Depending upon the
     liquid in contact with retention member 216 during polynucleotide release, the solution with
     released polynucleotide may be neutralized with an amount of buffer (e.g., an equal volume of
     25 - 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0).
              While releasing the polynucleotides has been described as including a heating step, the
  5  polynucleotides may be released without heating. For example, in some embodiments, the liquid
     of reservoir 281 has an ionic strength, pH, surfactant concentration, composition, or combination
     thereof that releases the polynucleotides from the retention member.
              While the polynucleotides have been described as being released into a single volume of
     liquid present within processing region 220, other configurations can be used. For example,
    polynucleotides may be released with the concomitant (stepwise or continuous) introduction of
     fluid into and/or through processing region 220. In such embodiments, the polynucleotides may
    be released into liquid having a volume of about 10 times or less (e.g., about 7.5 times or less,
     about 5 times or less, about 2.5 times or less, about 2 times or less) than the void volume of the
    processing region 220.
5            While reservoirs 279, 281 have been described as holding liquids between first and
    second gates, other configurations can be used. For example, liquid for each reservoir may be
    held within a pouch (e.g., a blister pack) isolated from network 201 by an generally impermeable
    membrane. The pouch is configured so that a user can rupture the membrane driving liquid into
    reservoirs 279, 281 where actuators 244, 248 can move the liquid during use.
)            While processing regions have been described as having microliter scale dimensions,
    other dimensions can be used. For example, processing regions with surfaces (e.g., particles)
    configured to preferentially retain polynucleotides as opposed to inhibitors may have large
                                                       18

        WO 2005/108620                                                          PCT/US2005/015345
    volumes (e.g., many tens of microliters or more, at least about 1 milliliter or more). In some
    embodiments, the processing region has a bench-top scale.
            While processing region 220 has been described as having a retention member formed of
    multiple surface-modified particles, other configurations can be used. For example, in some
 5  embodiments, processing region 220 includes a retention member configured as a porous
    member (e.g., a filter, a porous membrane, or a gel matrix) having multiple openings (e.g., pores
    and/or channels) through which polynucleotides pass. Surfaces of the porous member are
    modified to preferentially retain polynucleotides. Filter membranes available from, for example,
    Osmonics, are formed of polymers that may be surface-modified and used to retain
 3 polynucleotides within processing region 220. In some embodiments, processing region 220
    includes a retention member configured as a plurality of surfaces (e.g., walls or baffles) through
   which a sample passes. The walls or baffles are modified to preferentially retain
   polynucleotides.
            While processing region .220 has been described as a component of a microfluidic
 5 network, other configurations can be used. For example, in some embodiments, the retention
   member can be removed from a processing region for processing elsewhere. For example, the
   retention member may be contacted with a mixture comprising polynucleotides and inhibitors in
   one location and then moved to another location at which the polynucleotides are removed from
   the retention member.
 )         While reservoirs 275 have been shown as dispersed within a carrier, other configurations
   may be used. For example, reservoirs 275 can be encased within a flexible enclosure formed by
   a, for example, (e.g., a membrane, for example, an enclosure such as a sack). In some
   embodiments, reservoirs are loose within chamber 272. In such embodiments, actuator 244 may
   include a porous member having pores too small to permit passage of reservoirs 275 but large
5  enough to permit gas to exit chamber 272.
           Microfluidic devices with various components are described in U.S. provisional
   application no. 60/553,553 filed March 17, 2004 by Parunak et al., which application is
   incorporated herein by reference.
           While microfluidic device 300 has been described as configured to receive
0  polynucleotides already released from cells, microfluidic devices can be configured to release
   polynucleotides from cells (e.g., by lysing the cells). For example, referring to FIGS. 4-6, a
   microfluidic device 300 includes a sample lysing chamber 302 in which cells are lysed to release
                                                    19

         WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
     polynucleotides therein. Microfluidic device 300 further includes substrate layers Ll-L3, a
     microfluidic network 304 (only portions of which are seen in FIG. 4), and liquid reagent
     reservoirs Rl-R4. Liquid reagent reservoirs Rl-R4 hold liquid reagents (e.g., for processing
     sample material) and are connected to network 304 by reagent ports RP1-RP4.
 5           Network 304 is substantially defined between layers L2 and L3 but extends in part
    between all three layers Ll-L3. Microfluidic network 304 includes multiple components
     including channels Ci, valves Vi, double valves V'j, gates Gi, mixing gates MGi, vents Hi, gas
     actuators (e.g., pumps) Pi, a first processing region B 1, a second processing region B2, detection
    zones Di, air vents AVi, and waste zones Wi. Components of network 304 are typically
 0  thermally actuated. As seen in FIG. 7, a heat source network 312 includes heat sources (e.g.,
    resistive heat sources) having locations that correspond to components of microfluidic network
    304. For example, the locations of heat sources HPi correspond to the locations of actuators Pi,
    the locations of heat sources HGi correspond to locations of gates Gi and mixing gates, the
    locations of heat sources HVi correspond to the locations of valves Vi and double valves V'i,
 5  and the locations of heat sources HD1 correspond to the locations of processing chambers Di of
    network 304. In use, the components of device 300 are disposed in thermal contact with
    corresponding heat sources of network 312, which is typically operated using a processor as
    described above for device 200. Heat source network 312 can be integral with or separate from
    device 300 as described for device 200.
 3          We next discuss components of microfluidic device 300.
            Air vents AVi are components that allow gas (e.g., air) displaced by the movement of
   liquids within network 304 to be vented so that pressure buildup does not inhibit desired
   movement of the liquids. For example, air vent AV2 permits liquid to move along channel C14
   and into channel C16 by venting gas downstream of the liquid through vent AV2.
5           Valves Vi are components that have a normally open state allowing material to pass
   along a channel from a position on one side of the valve (e.g., upstream of the valve) to a
   position on the other side of the valve (e.g., downstream of the valve). The valves Vi can have
   the same structure as valves of microfluidic device 200.
            As seen in FIGS. 8 and 9, double valves V'i are also components that have a normally
0  open state allowing material to pass along a channel from a position on one side of the valve
   (e.g., upstream of the valve) to a position on the other side of the valve (e.g., downstream of the
   valve). Taking double valve V 11' of FIGS. 8 and 9 as an example, double valves Vi' include
                                                      20

         WO 2005/108620                                                         PCT/US2005/015345
     first and second masses 314, 316 of a TRS (e.g., a eutectic alloy or wax) spaced apart from one
     another on either side of a channel (e.g., channel C14). Typically, the TRS masses 314, 316 are
     offset from one another (e.g., by a distance of about 50% of a width of the TRS masses or less).
    Material moving through the open valve passes between the first and second TRS masses
 5  314,316. Each TRS mass 314, 316 is associated with a respective chamber 318, 320, which
    typically includes a gas (e.g., air).
             The TRS masses 314, 316 and chambers 318, 320 of double valve Vi' are in thermal
    contact with a corresponding heat source HV1 1' of heat source network 312. Actuating heat
    source HV1 1' causes TRS masses 314, 316 to transition to a more mobile second state (e.g., a
 0  partially melted state) and increases the pressure of gas within chambers 318, 320. The gas
    pressure drives TRS masses 314, 316 across channel C11 and closes valve HV1 1' (FIG. 9).
    Typically, masses 314, 316 at least partially combine to form a mass 322 that obstructs channel
    C11.
             Returning to FIG. 6, gates Gi are components that have a normally closed state that does
 5  not allow material to pass along a channel from a position on one side of the gate to another side
    of the gate. Gates Gi can have the same structure as described for gates of device 200.
             As seen in FIGS. 1OA-1OD, mixing gates MGi are components that allow two volumes of
    liquid to be combined (e.g., mixed) within network 304. Mixing gates MGi are discussed further
   below.
 )           Actuators Pi are components that provide a gas pressure to move material (e.g., sample
   material and/or reagent material) between one location of network 304 and another location.
   Actuators Pi can be the same as actuators of device 200. For example, each actuator Pi includes
   a chamber with a mass 273 of TEM that can be heated to pressurize gas within the chamber.
   Each actuator Pi includes a corresponding gate Gi (e.g., gate G2 of actuator P1) that prevents
5  liquid from entering the chamber of the actuator. The gate is typically actuated (e.g., opened) to
   allow pressure created in the chamber of the actuator to enter the microfluidic network.
             Waste chambers Wi are components that can receive waste (e.g., overflow) liquid
   resulting from the manipulation (e.g., movement and/or mixing) of liquids within network 304.
   Typically, each waste chamber Wi has an associated air vent that allows gas displaced by liquid
0  entering the chamber to be vented.
             First processing region B 1 is a component that allows polynucleotides to be concentrated
   and/or separated from inhibitors of a sample. Processing region B1 can be configured and
                                                     21

         WO 2005/108620                                                          PCT/US2005/015345
     operated as processing region 220 of device 200. In some embodiments, first processing region
     BI includes a retention member (e.g., multiple particles (e.g., microspheres or beads), a porous
    member, multiple walls) having at least one surface modified with one or more ligands as
     described for processing region 220. For example, the ligand can include one or more
 5  polyamides (e.g., poly-cationic polyamides such as poly-L-lysine, poly-D-lysine, poly-DL
    ornithine). In some embodiments, particles of the retention member are disposed lysing chamber
    302 and are moved into processing region BI along with sample material.
             Second processing region B2 is a component that allows material (e.g., sample material)
    to be combined with compounds (e.g., reagents) for determining the presence of one or more
    polynucleotides. In some embodiments, the compounds include one or more PCR reagents (e.g.,
    primers, control plasmids, and polymerase enzymes). Typically, the compounds are stored
    within processing region as one or more lyophilized particles (e.g., pellets). The particles
    generally have a room temperature (e.g., about 20 C) shelf-life of at least about 6 months (e.g.,
    at least about 12 months). Liquid entering the second processing region B2 dissolves (e.g.,
   reconstitutes) the lyophilized compounds.
             Typically, the lyophilized particle(s) of processing region B2 have an average volume of
   about 5 microliters or less (e.g., about 4 microliters or less, about 3 microliters or less, about 2
   microliters or less). In some embodiments, the lyophilized particle(s) of processing region B2
   have an average diameter of about 4 mm or less (e.g., about 3 mm or less, about 2 mm or less)
   In an exemplary embodiment the lyophilized particle(s) have an average volume of about 2
   microliters and an average diameter of about 1.35 mm.           Lyophilized particles for determining
   the presence of one or more polynucleotides typically include multiple compounds. In some
   embodiments, the lyophilized particles include one or more compounds used in a reaction for
   determining the presence of a polynucleotide and/or for increasing the concentration of the
5  polynucleotide. For example, lypophilized particles can include one or more enzymes for
   amplifying the polynucleotide as by PCR. We next discuss exemplary lyophilized particles that
   include exemplary reagents for the amplification of polynucleotides associated with group B
   streptococcus (GBS) bacteria. In some embodiments, the lyophilized particles include a
   cryoprotectant, one or more salts, one or more primers (e.g., GBS Primer F and/or GBS Primer
   R), one or more probes (e.g., GBS Probe - FAM), one or more internal control plasmids, one or
   more specificity controls (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA as a control for PCR of GBS),
   one or more PCR reagents (e.g., dNTPs and/or dUTPs), one or more blocking or bulking agents
                                                      22

        WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
    (e.g., non-specific proteins (e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), RNAseA, or gelatin), and a
    polymerase (e.g., glycerol-free Taq Polymerase). Of course, other components (e.g., other
    primers and/or specificity controls) can be used for amplification of other polynucleotides.
             Cryoprotectants generally help increase the stability of the lypophilized particles and help
 5  prevent damage to other compounds of the particles (e.g., by preventing denaturation of enzymes
    during preparation and/or storage of the particles). In some embodiments, the cryoprotectant
    includes one or more sugars (e.g., one or more dissacharides (e.g., trehalose, melizitose,
   raffinose)) and/or one or more poly-alcohols (e.g., mannitol, sorbitol).
            Lyophilized particles can be prepared as desired. Typically, compounds of the
 D  lyophilized particles are combined with a solvent (e.g., water) to make a solution, which is then
   placed (e.g., in discrete aliquots (e.g., drops) such as by pipette) onto a chilled hydrophobic
   surface (e.g., a diamond film or a polytetrafluorethylene surface). In general, the temperature of
   the surface is reduced to near the temperature of liquid nitrogen (e.g., about -150 OF or less,
   about -200 OF or less, about -275 OF or less). The solution freezes as discrete particles. The
 5 frozen particles are subjected to a vacuum while still frozen for a pressure and time sufficient to
   remove the solvent (e.g., by sublimation) from the pellets.
            In general, the concentrations of the compounds in the solution from which the particles
   are made is higher than when reconstituted in the microfluidic device. Typically, the ratio of the
   solution concentration to the reconstituted concentration is at least about 3 (e.g., at least about
 ) 4.5). In some embodiments, the ratio is about 6.
            An exemplary solution for preparing lyophilized pellets for use in the amplification of
   polynucleotides indicative of the presence of GBS can be made by combining a cryoprotecant
   (e.g., 120 mg of trehalose as dry powder), a buffer solution (e.g., 48 microliters of a solution of
   1M Tris at pH 8.4, 2.5M KCl, and 200mM MgCl 2), a first primer (e.g., 1.92 microliters of 500
5  micromolar GBS Primer F (Invitrogen)), a second primer (e.g., 1.92 microliters of 500
   micromolar GBS Primer R (Invitrogen)), a probe (e.g., 1.92 microliters of 250 micromolar GBS
   Probe - FAM (IDT / Biosearch Technologies)), an control probe (e.g., 1.92 microliters of 250
   micromolar Cal Orange 560 (Biosearch Technologies)), a template plasmid (e.g., 0.6 microliters
   of a solution of 105 copies plasmid per microliter), a specificity control (e.g., 1.2 microliters of a
0  solution of 10 nanograms per microliter (e.g., about 5,000,000 copies per microliter)
   streptococcus pneumoniae DNA (ATCC)), PCR reagents (e.g., 4.8 microliters of a 100
   millimolar solution of dNTPs (Epicenter) and 4.microliters of a 20 millimolar solution of dUTPs

        WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
     (Epicenter)), a bulking agent (e.g., 24 microliters of a 50 milligram per milliliter solution of BSA
     (Invitrogen)), a polymerase (e.g., 60 microliters of a 5 U per microliter solution of glycerol-free
     Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen / Eppendorf)) and a solvent (e.g., water) to make about 400
     microliters of solution. About 200 aliquots of about 2 microliters each of this solution are frozen
 5   and desolvated as described above to make 200 pellets. When reconstituted, the 200 particles
     make a PCR reagent solution having a total volume of about 2.4 milliliters.
             As seen in FIG. 5, reagent reservoirs Ri are configured to hold liquid reagents (e.g.,
     water, buffer solution, hydroxide solution) separated from network 304 until ready for use.
     Reservoirs R1 include an enclosure 329 that defines a sealed space 330 for holding liquids. Each
 0   space 330 is separated from reagent port RPi and network 304 by a lower wall 33 of enclosure
     329. A portion of enclosure 329 is formed as a piercing member 331 oriented toward the lower
    wall 333 of each enclosure. When device 300 is to be used, reagent reservoirs Ri are actuated by
    depressing piercing member 331 to puncture wall 333. Piercing member 331 can be depressed
    by a user (e.g., with a thumb) or by the operating system used to operate device 300.
 5           When wall 333 is punctured, fluid from the reservoir enters network 333. For example,
    as seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, liquid from reservoir R2 enters network 304 by port RP2 and travels
    along a channel C2. Gate G3 prevents the liquid from passing along channel C8. Excess liquid
    passes along channel C7 and into waste chamber W2. When the trailing edge of liquid from
    reservoir R2 passes hydrophobic vent H2, pressure created within the reservoir is vented
 )  stopping further motion of the liquid. Consequently, network 304 receives an aliquot of liquid
   reagent having a volume defined by the volume of channel C2 between a junction Ji and a
   junction J2. When actuator P1 is actuated, this aliquot of reagent is moved further within
   network 304. Reagent reservoirs R1, R3, and R4 are associated with corresponding channels,
   hydrophobic vents, and actuators.
5           In the configuration shown, reagent reservoir R1 typically holds a release liquid (e.g., a
   hydroxide solution as discussed above for device 200) for releasing polynucleotides retained
   within processing region B1. Reagent reservoir R2 typically holds a wash liquid (e.g., a buffer
   solution as discussed above for device 200) for removing un-retained compounds (e.g.,
   inhibitors) from processing region B 1 prior to releasing the polynucleotides. Reagent reservoir
0  R3 typically holds a neutralization buffer (e.g., 25 - 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0). Reagent
   reservoir R4 typically holds deionized water.
            Lysing chamber 302 is divided into a primary lysing chamber 306 and a waste chamber
                                                     24

     308. Material cannot pass from one of chambers 306, 308 into the other chamber without
    passing through at least a portion of network 304. Primary lysing chamber 306 includes a
    sample input port SPI for introducing sample to chamber 306, a sample output port SP2
    connecting chamber 306 to network 304, and lyophilized reagent LP that interact with sample
 5  material within chamber 306 as discussed below. Input port SP1 includes a one way valve that
    permits material (e.g., sample material and gas) to enter chamber 306 but limits (e.g., prevents)
    material from exiting chamber 308 by port SPI. Typically, port SP1 includes a fitting (e.g., a
    Luer fitting) configured to mate with a sample input device (e.g., a syringe) to form a gas-tight
    seal. Primary chamber 306 typically has a volume of about 5 milliliters or less (e.g., about 4
 0  milliliters or less). Prior to use, primary chamber 306 is typically filled with a gas (e.g., air).
              Waste chamber 308 includes a waste portion W6 by which liquid can enter chamber 308
    from network 304 and a vent 310 by which gas displaced by liquid entering chamber 308 can
    exit.
              Lyophilized reagent particles LP of lysing chamber 302 include one or more compounds
 5  (e.g., reagents) configured to release polynucleotides from cells (e.g., by lysing the cells). For
   example, particles LP can include one or more enzymes configured to reduce (e.g., denature)
   proteins (e.g., proteinases, proteases (e.g., pronase), trypsin, proteinase K, phage lytic enzymes
   (e.g., PlyGBS)), lysozymes (e.g., a modified lysozyme such as ReadyLyse), cell specific
   enzymes (e.g., mutanolysin for lysing group B streptococci)).
 3           In some embodiments, articles LP typically alternatively or additionally include
   components for retaining polynucleotides as compared to inhibitors. For example, particles LP
   can include multiple particles 218 surface modified with ligands as discussed above for device
   200. Particles LP can include enzymes that reduce polynucleotides that might compete with a
   polynucleotide to be determined for binding sites on the surface modified particles. For
5  example, to reduce RNA that might compete with DNA to be determined, particles LP may
   include an enzyme such as an RNAase (e.g., RNAseA ISC BioExpress (Amresco)).
             In an exemplary embodiment, particles LP cells include a cryoprotecant, particles
   modified with ligands configured to retain polynucleotides as compared to inhibitors, and one or
   more enzymes.
0            Typically, particles LP have an average volume of about 35 microliters or less (e.g.,
   about 27.5 microliters or less, about 25 microliters or less, about 20 microliters or less). In some
   embodiments, the particles LP have an average diameter of about 8 mm or less (e.g., about 5 mm
                                                      25

         WO 2005/108620                                                            PCT/US2005/015345
     or less, about 4 mm or less) In an exemplary embodiment the lyophilized particle(s) have an
     average volume of about 20 microliters and an average diameter of about 3.5 mm.
              Particles LP can be prepared as desired. Typically, the particles are prepared using a
     cryoprotectant and chilled hydrophobic surface as described above. For example, a solution for
 5  preparing particles LP can be prepared by combining a cryoprotectant (e.g., 6 grams of
     trehalose), a plurality of particles modified with ligands (e.g., about 2 milliliters of a suspension
     of carboxylate modified particles with poly-D-lysine ligands), a protease (e.g., 400 milligrams of
    pronase), an RNAase (e.g., 30 milligrams of RNAseA (activity of 120 U per milligram), an
    enzyme that digests peptidoglycan (e.g., ReadyLyse (e.g., 160 microliters of a 30000 U per
 )  microliter solution of ReadyLyse)), a cell specific enzyme (e.g., mutanolysin (e.g., 200
    microliters of a 50 U per microliter solution of mutanolysin), and a solvent (e.g., water) to make
    about 20 milliters. About 1000 aliquots of about 20 microliters each of this solution are frozen
    and desolvated as described above to make 1000 pellets. When reconstituted, the pellets are
    typically used to make a total of about 200 milliliters of solution.
             In use, device 300 can be operated as follows. Valves Vi and Vi' of network 304 are
    configured in the open state. Gates Gi and mixing gates MGi of network 304 are configured in
    the closed state. Reagent ports R1-R4 are depressed to introduce liquid reagents into network
    304 as discussed above. A sample is introduced to lysing chamber 302 via port SP1 and
    combined with lyophilized particles LP within primary lysing chamber 306. Typically, the
    sample includes a combination of particles (e.g., cells) and a buffer solution. For example, an
    exemplary sample includes about 2 parts whole blood to 3 about parts buffer solution (e.g., a
   solution of 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1%SDS). Another exemplary sample
   includes group B streptococci and a buffer solution (e.g., a solution of 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 1
   mM EDTA, and 1%Triton X-100).
5            In general, the volume of sample introduced is smaller than the total volume of primary
   lysing chamber 306. For example, the volume of sample may be about 50% or less (e.g., about
   35 % or less, about 30% or less) of the total volume of chamber 306. A typical sample has a
   volume of about 3 milliliters or less (e.g., about 1.5 milliliters or less). A volume of gas (e.g.,
   air) is generally introduced to primary chamber 306 along with the sample. Typically, the
D  volume of gas introduced is about 50% or less (e.g., about 35 % or less, about 30% or less) of the
   total volume of chamber 306. The volume of sample and gas combine to pressurize the gas
   already present within chamber 306. Valve 307 of port SPI prevents gas from exiting chamber
                                                      26

         WO 2005/108620                                                             PCT/US2005/015345
     306. Because gates G3, G4, G8, and G10 are in the closed state, the pressurized sample is
     prevented from entering network 304 via port SP2.
             The sample dissolves particles LP in chamber 306. Reconstituted lysing reagents (e.g.,
     ReadyLyse, mutanolysin) begin to lyse cells of the sample releasing polynucleotides. Other
 5  reagents (e.g., protease enzymes such as pronase) begin to reduce or denature inhibitors (e.g.,
    proteins) within the sample. Polynucleotides from the sample begin to associate with (e.g., bind
    to) ligands of particles 218 released from particles LP. Typically, the sample within chamber
    306 is heated (e.g., to at least about 50 0 C, to at least about 60 'C) for a period of time (e.g., for
    about 15 minutes or less, about 10 minutes or less, about 7 minutes or less) while lysing occurs.
 3  In some embodiments, optical energy is used at least in part to heat contents of lysing chamber
    306. For example, the operating system used to operate device 300 can include a lamp (e.g., a
    lamp primarily emitting light in the infrared) disposed in thermal and optical contact with
    chamber 306. Chamber 306 includes a temperature sensor TS used to monitor the temperature
    of the sample within chamber 306. The lamp output is increased or decreased based on the
 5  temperature determined with sensor TS.
            Continuing with the operation of device 300, G2 is actuated (e.g., opened) providing a
   path between port SP2 of primary lysing chamber 306 and port W6 of lysing waste chamber 308.
    The path extends along channel C9, channel C8, through processing region B1, and channel C11.
   Pressure within chamber 306 drives the lysed sample material (containing lysate,
   polynucleotides bound to particles 218, and other sample components) along the pathway.
   Particles 218 (with polynucleotides) are retained within processing region B 1 (e.g., by a filter)
   while the liquid and other components of the sample flow into waste chamber 308. After a
   period of time (e.g., between about 2 and about 5 minutes), the pressure in lysing chamber 306 is
   vented by opening gate G1 to create a second pathway between ports SP2 and W6. Double
5  valves V1' and V8' are closed to isolate lysing chamber 302 from network 304.
            Operation of device 300 continues by actuating pump P1 and opening gates G2,G3 and
   G9. Pump P1 drives wash liquid in channel C2 downstream of junction JI through processing
   region B1 and into waste chamber W5. The wash liquid removes inhibitors and other
   compounds not retained by particles 218 from processing region B 1. When the trailing edge of
0  the wash liquid (e.g., the upstream interface) passes hydrophobic vent H14, the pressure from
   actuator P1 vents from network 304, stopping further motion of the liquid. Double valves V2'
   and V9' are closed.

              Operation continues by actuating pump P2 and opening gates G6, G4 and G8 to move
      release liquid from reagent reservoir R1 into processing region B1 and into contact with particles
      218. Air vent AVI vents pressure ahead of the moving release liquid. Hydrophobic vent H6
      vents pressure behind the trailing edge of the release liquid stopping further motion of the release
 5    liquid. Double valves V6' and V10' are closed.
              Operation continues by heating processing region BI (e.g., by heating particles 218) to
     release the polynucleotides from particles 218. The particles can be heated as described above
     for device 200. Typically, the release liquid includes about 15 mM hydroxide (e.g., NaOH
     solution) and the particles are heated to about 70 *C for about 2 minutes to release the
 3   polynucleotides from the particles 218.
              Operation continues by actuating pump P3 and opening gates G5 and G1O to move
     release liquid from process region B 1 downstream. Air vent AV2 vents gas pressure
     downstream of the release liquid allowing the liquid to move into channel C16. Hydrophobic
     vent H8 vents pressure from upstream of the release liquid stopping further movement. Double
 5  valve VII' and valve V14 are closed.
             Referring to FIGS. 1OA-1OD, mixing gate MG 11 is used to mix a portion of release
    liquid including polynucleotides released from particles 218 and neutralization buffer from
    reagent reservoir R3. FIG. 1OA shows the mixing gate MG 11 region prior to depressing reagent
    reservoir R3 to introduce the neutralization buffer into network 304. FIG. 1OB shows the mixing
    gate MG 11 region, after the neutralization buffer has been introduced into channels C13 and
    C12. Double valve V13' is closed to isolate network 304 from reagent reservoir R3. Double
    valve V12' is closed to isolate network 304 from waste chamber W3. The neutralization buffer
    contacts one side of a mass 324 of TRS of gate MG1 1.
             FIG. 1Oc shows the mixing gate MG1 1 region after release liquid has been moved into
5  channel C16. The dimensions of microfluidic network 304 (e.g., the channel dimensions and the
   position of hydrophobic vent H8) are configured so that the portion of release liquid positioned
   between junctions J3 and J4 of channels C16 and C14 corresponds approximately to the volume
   of liquid in contact with particles 218 during the release step. In some embodiments, the volume
   of liquid positioned between junctions J3 and J4 is less than about 5 microliters (e.g., about 4
   microliters or less, about 2.5 microliters or less). In an exemplary embodiment the volume of
   release liquid between junctions J3 and J4 is about 1.75 microliters. Typically, the liquid
   between junctions J3 and J4 includes at least about 50% of polynucleotides (at least about 75%,

               Before actuating mixing gate MG1 1, the release liquid at junction J4 and the
      neutralization buffer at a junction J6 between channels C13 and C12 are separated only be mass
 5    324 of TRS (e.g., the liquids are not spaced apart by a volume of gas). To combine the release
      liquid and neutralization buffer, pump P4 and gates G12, G13, and MG1 1 are actuated. Pump
     P4 drives the volume of neutralization liquid between junctions J5 and J6 and the volume of
     release liquid between junctions J4 and J3 into mixing channel C15 (FIG. 1OD). Mass 324 of
     TRS typically disperses and/or melts allowing the two liquids to combine. The combined liquids
 )   include a downstream interface 335 (formed by junction J3) and an upstream interface (formed
     by junction J5). The presence of these interfaces allows more efficient mixing (e.g., recirculation
     of the combined liquid) than if the interfaces were not present. As seen in FIG. 1OD, mixing
     typically begins near the interface between the two liquids. Mixing channel C15 is typically at
     least about as long (e.g., at least about twice as long) as a total length of the combined liquids
    within the channel.
               The volume of neutralization buffer combined with the release liquid is determined by
    the channel dimensions between junction J5 and J6. Typically, the volume of combined
    neutralization liquid is about the same as the volume of combined release liquid. In some
    embodiments, the volume of liquid positioned between junctions J5 and J6 is less than about 5
    microliters (e.g., about 4 microliters or less, about 2.5 microliters or less). In an exemplary
    embodiment the volume of release liquid between junctions J5 and J6 is about 2.25 microliters
    (e.g., the total volume of release liquid and neutralization buffer is about 4 microliters).
              Returning to FIG. 6, the combined release liquid and neutralization buffer move along
   mixing channel C15 and into channel C32 (vented downstream by air vent AV8). Motion
5  continues until the upstream interface of the combined liquids passes hydrophobic vent

   (neutralized release liquid with sample polynucleotides in detection region D2 with PCR
  reagents from dissolved lyophilized particle solution and deionized water with PCR reagents
  from dissolved lyophilized particle solution in detection region Dl) are subjecting to heating and
  cooling steps to amplify polynucleotides (if present in detection region D2). The double valves

             Once sample and, if necessary, reagent have been added to device 700, cap 710 is closed

            Device 700 may be used to reduce the amount of inhibitors present relative to the amount
5  of polynucleotides to be determined. Thus, the sample is eluted through processing region 702
   to contact constituents of the sample with beads 705. Beads 705 retain polynucleotides of the
   sample as compared to inhibitors as described elsewhere herein. With valve 714 in the open
   state, sample constituents not retained in processing region 702 exit device 700 via the opening.
            Once the polynucleotide-containing sample has eluted through processing region 702, an
0  amount of reagent, e.g., a wash solution, e.g., a buffer such as Tris-EDTA pH 8.0 with 1%Triton
   X 100 is eluted through processing region 702. The wash solution is generally stored in reagent
   reservoir 706, which may include a valve configured to release an amount of wash solution. The

      wash solution elutes remaining polynucleotide-containing sample and inhibitors without eluting
     retained polynucleotides.
             Once inhibitors have been separated from retained polynucleotides, the polynucleotides
     are released from beads 705. In some embodiments, polynucleotides are released by contacting
 5   the beads 705 with a release solution, e.g., a NaOH solution or buffer solution having a pH
     different from that of the wash solution. Alternatively, or in combination, beads 705 with
     retained polynucleotides are heated, such as by using second heat source 722 of operator 718.
     When heat is used to release the polynucleotides, the release solution may be identical with the
     wash solution.
 D           Gas pressure generator 708 may be used to expel an amount of release solution with
    released polynucleotides from device 700. Gas pressure generator and/or operator 718 may
    include a heat source to heat gas present within generator 708. The heated gas expands and
    provides the gas pressure to expel sample. In some embodiments, and whether or not thermally
    generated gas pressure is used, gas pressure generator 708 is configured to expel a predetermined
 5  volume of material. Typically, the amount of expelled solution is less than about 500 IL, less
    than about 250 yiL, less than about 100 yL, less than about 50 AL, e.g., less than about 25 yL.
    EXAMPLES
            The following Examples are illustrative and not intended to be limiting.
            Preparing Retention Member
            Carboxylate surface magnetic beads (Sera-Mag Magnetic Carboxylate modified, Part
    #3008050250, Seradyn) at a concentration of about 10" mL- were activated for 30 minutes
   using N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide
   (EDAC) in a pH 6.1 500 mM 2-(N-Morpholinio)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution.
5  Activated beads were incubated with 3000 Da or 300,000 Da average molecular weight poly-L
   lysine (PLL). After 2 washes to remove unbound PLL, beads were ready for use.
            Microfluidic Device
            Referring to Figs. 13 and 14, a microfluidic device 300 was fabricated to demonstrate
3  separation of polynucleotides from inhibitors. Device 300 comprises first and second substrate
   portions 302', 304', which respectively comprise first and second layers 302a', 302b' and 304a',
                                                     32

         WO 2005/108620                                                           PCT/US2005/015345
      304b'. First and second layers 302a', 302b' define a channel 306' comprising an inlet 310' and
      an outlet 312'. First and second layers 304a', 304b' define a channel 308' comprising an inlet
      314' and an outlet 316'. First and second substrate portions 302', 304' were mated using
      adhesive 324' so that outlet 312' communicated with inlet 314' with a filter 318' positioned
 5   therebetween. A portion of outlet 312' was filed with the activated beads prepared above to
     provide a processing region 320' comprising a retention member (the beads). A pipette 322'
     (Fig. 14) secured by adhesive 326' facilitated sample introduction.
              In use, sample introduced via inlet 310' passed along channel and through processing
     region 320'. Excess sample material passed along channel 308' and exited device 300' via outlet
 D   316'. Polynucleotides were preferentially retained by the beads as compared to inhibitors. Once
     sample had been introduced, additional liquids, e.g., a wash liquid and/or a liquid for use in
     releasing the retained polynucleotides were introduced via inlet 326'.
             Retention of DNA
 5           Retention of polynucleotides by the poly-L-lysine modified beads of device 300' was
    demonstrated by preparing respective devices comprising processing regions having a volume of.
    about 1 pL including about 1000 beads. The beads were modified with poly-L-lysine of between
    about 15,000 and 30,000 Da. Each processing region was filled with a liquid comprising herring
    sperm DNA (about 20 uL of sample with a concentration of about 20 mg/mL) thereby placing
    the beads and liquid in contact. After the liquid and beads had been in contact for 10 minutes,
    the liquid was removed from each processing region and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR
    to determine the amount of herring sperm DNA present in the liquid.
             Two controls were performed. First, an otherwise identical processing region was
   packed with un-modified beads, i.e., beads that were identical with the poly-L-lysine beads
5   except for the activation and poly-L-lysine incubation steps. The liquid comprising herring
   sperm DNA was contacted with these beads, allowed to stand for 10 minutes, removed, and
   subjected to quantitative real-time PCR. Second, the liquid comprising the herring sperm DNA
   ("the unprocessed liquid") was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR.
             Referring to Fig. 15, the first and second controls exhibited essentially identical
0  responses indicating the presence of herring sperm DNA in the liquid contacted with the
   unmodified beads and in the unprocessed liquid. The liquid that had contacted the 3,000 poly-L
                                                      33

         WO 2005/108620                                                         PCT/US2005/015345
     lysine beads exhibited a lower response indicating that the modified beads had retained
     substantially all of the herring sperm DNA. The PCR response of the liquid that had contacted
     the 300,000 Da poly-L-lysine beads exhibited an amplification response that was at least about
     50% greater than for the 3,000 Da beads indicating that the lower molecular weight surface
 5  modification was more efficient at retaining the herring sperm DNA.
             Releasing DNA From Poly-L-Lysine Modified Beads
             Devices having processing regions were packed with 3,000 Da poly-L-lysine modified
    beads. Liquid comprising polynucleotides obtained from group B streptococci (GBS) was
 3  contacted with the beads and incubated for 10 minutes as above for the herring sperm DNA.
    This liquid had been obtained by subjecting about 10,000 GBS bacteria in 10 [t1 of 20 mM Tris
    pH 8, 1mM EDTA, 1%Triton X-100 buffer to thermal lysing at 97 "C for 3 min.
             After 10 minutes, the liquid in contact with the beads was removed by flowing about 10
      I of wash solution (Tris-EDTA pH 8.0 with 1%Triton X 100) through the processing region.
 5  Subsequently, about 1 pl of 5 mM NaOH solution was added to the processing region. This
    process left the packed processing region filled with the NaOH solution in contact with the
    beads. The solution in contact with the beads was heated to 95 *C. After 5 minutes of heating at
    95 *C, the solution in contact with the beads was removed by eluting the processing region with a
    volume of solution equal to three times the void volume of the processing region.
            Referring to Fig. 16, five aliquots of solution were subjected to quantitative real-time
    PCR amplification. Aliquots El, E2, and E3 each contained about 1 sl of liquid. Aliquot L was
    corresponds to liquid of the original sample that had passed through the processing region.
   Aliquot W was liquid obtained from wash solution without heating. Aliquot El corresponds to
   the dead volume of device 300, about equal to the volume of channel 308. Thus, liquid of
5  aliquot El was present in channel 308 and not in contact with the beads during heating. This
   liquid had passed through the processing region prior to heating. Aliquot E2 comprises liquid
   that was present within the processing region and in contact with the beads during heating.
   Aliquot E3 comprises liquid used to remove aliquot E2 from the processing region.
            As seen in Fig. 16, more than 65% of the GBS DNA present in the initial sample was
0  retained by and released from the beads (Aliquot E2). Aliquot E2 also demonstrates the release
   of more than 80% of the DNA that had been retained by the beads. Less than about 18% of the
   GBS DNA passed through the processing region without being captured. The wash solution
                                                     34

         WO 2005/108620                                                         PCT/US2005/015345
      without heating comprised less than 5% of the GBS DNA (Aliquot W).
             Separation of Polynucleotides and Inhibitors
             Buccal cells from the lining of the cheeks provide a source of human genetic material
 5   (DNA) that may be used for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. A sample
     comprising buccal cells was subjected to thermal lysing to release DNA from within the cells.
     Device 300 was used to separate the DNA from concomitant inhibitors as described above. A
     cleaned-up sample corresponding to aliquot E2 of Fig. 16 was subjected to polymerase chain
     reaction. A control or crude sample as obtained from the thermal lysing was also amplified.
 )           Referring to Fig. 17, the cleaned-up sample exhibited substantially higher PCR response
    in fewer cycles than did the control sample. For example, the clean-up sample exceeded a
    response of 20 within 32 cycles whereas the control sample required about 45 cycles to achieve
    the sample response.
            Blood acts as a sample matrix in variety of diagnostic tests including detection of
 i  infectious disease agents, cancer markers and other genetic markers. Hemoglobin present in
    blood samples is a documented potent inhibitor of PCR. Two 5 ml blood samples were lysed in
    20 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS buffer and introduced to respective devices 300, which
    were operated as described above to prepare two clean-up samples. A third 5 ml blood sample
    was lysed and prepared using a commercial DNA extraction method Puregene, Gentra
                                                                                             Systems,
 I  MN. The respective cleaned-up samples and sample subjected to the commercial extraction
    method were used for a Allelic discrimination analysis (CYP2D6*4 reagents, Applied
   Biosystems, CA). Each sample contained an amount of DNA corresponding to about 1 ml of
   blood.
            Referring to Fig. 18, the cleaned-up and commercially extracted samples exhibited
5  similar PCR response demonstrating that the processing region of device 300' efficiently
   removed inhibitors from the blood samples.
            Protease Resistant Retention Member
            The preparation of polynucleotide samples for further processing often includes
   subjecting the samples to protease treatment in which a protease cleaves peptide bonds of
   proteins in the sample. An exemplary protease is pronase, a mixture of endo- and exo-proteases.
   Pronase cleaves most peptide bonds. Certain ligands, such as poly-L-lysine are susceptible to
                                                    35

        WO 2005/108620                                                         PCT/US2005/015345
     rupture by pronase and other proteases. Thus, if samples are generally not subjected to protease
    treatment in the presence of the retention member if the ligands bound thereto are susceptible to
    the proteases.
            Poly-D-lysine, the dextro enantiomer of poly-lysine resists cleavage by pronase and other
 5  proteases. The ability of a retention member comprising bound poly-D-lysine to retain DNA
    even when subjected to a protease treatment was studied.
            Eight (8) samples were prepared. A first group of 4 samples contained 1000 GBS cells in
    10 d buffer. A second group of 4 samples contained 100 GBS cells in 10 d buffer. Each of the
    8 samples was heated to 97 "C for 3 min to lyse the GBS cells. Four (4) sample sets were created
 3  from the heated samples. Each sample set contained 1 sample from each of the first and second
    groups. The samples of each sample sets were treated as follows.
            Referring to Fig. 19a, the samples of sample set 1 were subjected to pronase incubation to
    prepare respective protein cleaved samples, which were then heated to inactivate the proteases.
    The protein-cleaved, heated samples were contacted with respective retention members each
 5  comprising a set of poly-L-lysine modified beads. After 5 minutes, the respective sets of beads
    were washed with 5 microliters of a 5 mM NaOH solution to separate inhibitors and products of
   protein cleavage from the bound DNA. The respective sets of beads were each contacted with a
    second aliquot of NaOH solution and heated to 80 (eighty) 0C for 2 minutes to release the DNA.
   The solutions with released DNA were neutralized with an equal volume of buffer. The
   neutralized solutions were analyzed to determine the efficiency of DNA recovery. The results
   were averaged and shown in Fig. 19b.
            The samples of sample set 2 were subjected to pronase incubation to prepare respective
   protein cleaved samples, which were then heated to inactivate the proteases. The protein
   cleaved, heated samples were contacted with respective retention members each comprising a set
5  of poly-D-lysine modified beads. After 5 minutes, the respective sets of beads were washed with
   5 microliters of a 5 mM NaOH solution to separate inhibitors and products of protein cleavage
   from the bound DNA. The respective sets of beads were each contacted with a second aliquot of
   NaOH solution and heated to 80 (eighty) "C for 2 minutes to release the DNA. The solutions
   with released DNA were neutralized with an equal volume of buffer. The neutralized solutions
0  were analyzed to determine the efficiency of DNA recovery. The results were averaged and
   shown in Fig. 19b.
           The samples of sample set 3 were subjected to pronase incubation to prepare respective
                                                    36

      protein cleaved samples. The proteases were not deactivated either thermally or chemically.
      The protein-cleaved samples were contacted with respective retention members each comprising
      a set of poly-L-lysine modified beads. After 5 minutes, the respective sets of beads were washed
     with 5 microliters of a 5 mM NaOH solution to separate inhibitors and products of protein
 5    cleavage from the bound DNA. The respective sets of beads were each contacted with a second
     aliquot of NaOH solution and heated to 80 (eighty) "C for 2 minutes to release the DNA. The
     solutions with released polynucleotides were each neutralized with an equal volume of buffer.
     The neutralized solutions were analyzed to determine the efficiency of DNA recovery. The
     results were averaged and shown in Fig. 19b.
 )            The samples of sample set 4 were subjected to pronase incubation to prepare respective
    protein cleaved samples. The proteases were not deactivated either thermally or chemically.
     The protein-cleaved samples were contacted with respective retention members each comprising
    a set of poly-D-lysine modified beads. After 5 minutes, the respective sets of beads were washed
    with 5 microliters of a 5 mM NaOH solution to separate inhibitors and products of protein
    cleavage from the bound DNA. The respective sets of beads were each contacted with a second
    aliquot of NaOH solution and heated to 80 (eighty) "C for 2 minutes to release the DNA. The
    solutions with released polynucleotides were each neutralized with an equal volume of buffer:
    The neutralized solutions were analyzed to determine the efficiency of DNA recovery. The
    results were averaged and shown in Fig. 19b.
             As seen in Fig. 19b, an average of more than 80% of DNA from the GBS cells was
   recovered using sample set 4 in which the samples were contacted with poly-D-lysine modified
   beads and subjected to pronase incubation in the presence of the beads without protease
   inactivation. The recovery efficiency for sample set 4 is more than twice as high as for any of
   the other samples. Specifically, the recovery efficiencies for sample sets 1, 2, 3, and 4, were
5  29%, 32%, 14%, and 81.5%, respectively. The efficiencies demonstrate that high recovery
   efficiencies can be obtained for samples subjected to protease incubation in the presence of a
   retention member that retains DNA.
             Other embodiments are within the claims.
