                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to liquid compositions. More particularly, the present
invention relates to liquid compositions containing racecadotril and the method of making said
compositions.
Related Background Art
[0002] Diarrhea is an intestinal disorder that is characterized by an increase in the frequency of
watery bowel movements. It may result from a variety of causes including bacteria or viral
induced diarrhea. Food intolerance caused by allergy or the consumption of foods such as fatty
or spicy foods may result in diarrhea. Food poisoning may also lead to diarrhea. In some
instances, diarrhea may be a symptom of other conditions and diseases.
[0003] Diarrhea is symptomatic of an intestinal or other bodily function disorder. Various
prescription and nonprescription products can be taken for relief. However, many of these
products provide relief with some side effects.
[0004] Racecadotril is also used in the treatment of diarrhea. It reduces (i) hypersecretion of
water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, (ii) the incidence and duration of acute diarrhea
and (iii) diarrhea-associated symptoms.
[0005] Presently, racecadotril is available in solid oral dosage forms.

                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006] The present invention is directed to a liquid composition comprising racecadotril and
cyclodextrin.
[0007] In one embodiment, the inventive composition comprises about 0.01 wt.% to about 24.0
wt.% racecadotril and about 1 wt.% to about 95 wt.% of a cyclodextrin, wherein each wt.% is
based upon 100 ml of the composition.
[0008] The present invention also includes a method for treating a subject experiencing diarrhea
comprising the step of orally administering to the subject a composition comprising racecadotril
and cyclodextrin.
                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0009] As used herein, "stable" refers to a liquid composition substantially free of chemical
degradation of racecadotril or substantial color change. In one embodiment, the total chemical
degradant products of racecadotril should be less than 0.2 percent by weight (wt.%), e.g. less
than 0.1 wt.% based on the total wt.% of racecadotril when stored at 3 months and 40'C. In
another embodiment, the total chemical degradant products of racecadotril should be less than
0.2 percent by weight (wt.%), e.g. less than 0.1 wt.% based on the total wt.% of racecadotril
when stored at 6 months and 40'C.
[0010] The percent degradation products are determined by calculating the %peak area of the
degradation product peak areas relative to the peak areas of the Racecadotril peaks in the HPLC
chromatograms. In one embodiment, the total chemical degradant products of racecadotril
should be less than 0.5 % of racecadotril, e.g., less than 0.2 %based on of the total % of
racecadotril when stored at 3 months and 40'C.
[0011] The present invention is a liquid composition comprising racecadotril and cyclodextrin.
[0012] Racecadotril's efficacy in reducing the symptoms of diarrhea have been demonstrated in
various studies. One of the benefits of using racecadotril over other remedies is that in

                                                -3
comparative trials racecadotril was shown to have fewer adverse events such as post-treatment
constipation.
[0013] In the present invention, the racecadotril is included in a stable liquid composition.
[0014] Racecadotril is a compound with low water solubility, making it difficult to formulate
into liquid compositions. However, oral liquid compositions are the most preferred dosage form
for administering medications to the pediatric population.
[0015] In one embodiment, a RS racemic form of racecadotril is used. In another embodiment, a
R form of racecadotril is used.
[0016] Racecadotril is included in the liquid composition in an amount from about 0.01 grams to
about 0.5 grams per 100 ml of the liquid composition. Preferably, the racecadotril is about 0.05
grams to about 0.4 grams, and more preferably, about 0.1 grams to about 0.3 grams per 100 ml
of the liquid composition. In one embodiment, the racecadotril is about 0.25 grams per 100 ml
of liquid composition.
[0017] In one embodiment, the viscosity of the liquid composition is from about 1 to about 500
centipoise at room temperature (250 C) measured using a Brookfield Viscometer.
[0018] The pH of the liquid composition is from about 1 to about 6. Preferably, the pH is about 3
to about 5. More preferably, the pH is about 4.5.
[0019] In one embodiment, a buffering system may be included to maintain the pH at the value
or in the desired range. The buffer may be a citrate, an acetate, a phosphate, or mixtures thereof
Preferably, an acetate buffer is used.
[0020] In one embodiment the racecadotril is dissolved into the liquid composition.
[0021] Cyclodextrins are compounds used in a wide variety of products, which include
pharmaceutical, food, consumer and chemical products. They are synthesized from starch via an
enzymatic reaction.
[0022] Suitable cyclodextrins include, for example, alpha-cyclodextrin, beta-cyclodextrin,
gamma-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin, or
mixtures thereof.
[0023] In one embodiment, the cyclodextrin is hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. One source of
hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin is CAVASOL W7 available from International Speciality
Products Corporation (ISP).

                                                 -4
[0024] In another embodiment, the cyclodextrin is a sulfobutyl ether derivative of p
cyclodextrin, sold under the tradename CAPTISOL available from Captisol.
[0025] The cyclodextrin is included in the composition in an amount from about 1 grams to
about 70 grams per 100 ml of the liquid composition. Preferably, the cyclodextrin is about 5
grams to about 60 grams, and more preferably, about 5 grams to about 50 grams per 100 ml of
the liquid composition.
[0026] In one embodiment, the cyclodextrin is from about 40 grams to about 60 grams per 100
ml of the liquid composition.
[0027] In another embodiment, the cyclodextrin is from about 15 grams to about 30 grams per
100 ml of the liquid composition.
[0028] The liquid composition also has water. Water is the solvent that fills the gap after all
other components have been added. The amount of water that is included varies because the
water is added to bring the composition up to a desired volume amount.
[0029] Optionally, a variety of ingredients may be included in the liquid composition of the
present invention.
[0030] For example, propylene glycol may be included in the liquid composition. Propylene
glycol has many uses, such as for example a moisturizer in food and medicines, and as a solvent
for food colorings and flavorings. It is a colorless, nearly odorless, clear, viscous liquid with a
faintly sweet taste, hygroscopic and miscible with water, acetone, and chloroform.
[0031] Any coloring agent suitable for use in a food or pharmaceutical product may be used in
the present inventive composition. Typical coloring agents include, for example, azo dyes,
quinopthalone dyes, triphenylmethane dyes, xanthene dyes, indigoid dyes, iron oxides, iron
hydroxides, titanium dioxide, natural dyes, and mixtures thereof More specifically, suitable
colorants include, but are not limited to patent blue V, acid brilliant green BS, red 2G, azorubine,

yellow, titanium dioxide, riboflavin, carotenes, antyhocyanines, turmeric, cochineal extract,
clorophyllin, canthaxanthin, caramel, betanin, and mixtures thereof.

                                                    -5
[0032] Similarly, a flavor may be included in the liquid composition. The amount of flavor
added to the composition will be dependent upon the desired taste characteristics.
[0033] The composition may contain other ingredients or components, such as aromas;
sweeteners such as, sorbitol, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, and high intensity sweeteners such
as sucralose, aspartame and saccharine and the like; viscosity modifiers such as xanthan gum;
preservatives such as sodium benzoate NF, buffers such as citric acid and/or sodium chloride;
surfactants such as polysorbate 80 and/or sodium lauryl sulfate or mixtures thereof
[0034] In one embodiment, the inventive liquid composition includes about 0.1 wt.% to about
0.3 wt.% racecadotril and about 40 wt.% to about 65 wt.% cyclodextrin, wherein each wt.% is
based upon 100 ml of the composition.
[0035] In another embodiment, the inventive liquid composition includes about 0.1 wt.% to
about 0.3 wt.% racecadotril and about 10 wt.% to about 40 wt.% cyclodextrin, wherein each
wt.% is based upon 100 ml of the composition.
[0036] The solubility of the racecadotril in the inventive composition is about 1.5 to about 4.0
mg/ml.
[0037] The liquid composition of the present invention may be made by any method known to
those skilled in the art so long as it results in the desired composition.
[0038] Suitable methods include, for example, combining each ingredient in a mixing kettle,
where the ingredients may be added sequentially or in any manner so long as the intended result
is achieved. Moreover, the mixing action should be sufficient to incorporate each ingredient into
the composition.
[0039] In one embodiment the liquid of the present invention comprises a second active
ingredient. The second active ingredient may be, for example, present in a suspended state, or
may be solubilized in the liquid composition. In one embodiment, the second active ingredient is
a digestive health active ingredient may be, for example, laxatives, antacids, proton pump
inhibitors, anti-gas agents, antiemetics, H2 blockers, a second antidiarrheal agent, and the like.
In one embodiment, the second active ingredient is microencapsulated.
[0040] Suitable anti-gas agents include but are not limited to simethicone.
[0041] Suitable additional antidiarrheal agents include but are not limited to loperamide.

                                                 -6
[0042] The inventive liquid composition may be delivered in any suitable delivery system. For
example, in one embodiment, the liquid composition is delivered orally. In another embodiment,
the composition is a liquid oral dosage form. In still another embodiment, a soft shell solid
dosage form is used to deliver the liquid composition. In still yet another embodiment, a hard
shell solid dosage form is used to deliver the liquid composition. In still yet another
embodiment, a tablet dosage form is used to deliver the liquid composition.
[0043] The present invention also includes a method for treating a subject experiencing diarrhea
comprising the step of orally administering to the subject a composition comprising racecadotril
and cyclodextrin.
